And I’m grateful\\nfor the confidence our shareholders have shown in supporting our mission.\\n\\xa0\\nOur annual shareholder meeting is an opportunity\\nto reflect on where we are today, and to look toward a future defined by innovation. We’ll hold this year’s meeting on February\\n28, 2024, and as always, I hope you’ll join us.\\n\\xa0\\nIt’s been a remarkable year. In 2023, we made\\nhistory by introducing the world to Apple’s first spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro — a revolutionary product that seamlessly\\nblends digital content with the physical world, opening a whole new dimension for our users. We also launched our powerful iPhone 15 lineup\\n— including the iPhone 15 Pro models — which continues to win over customers around the world with its profound innovations.\\n\\xa0\\nWe’re a company that’s always looking\\nforward, driven by a belief in the meaningful difference technology can make for our customers. Today — from iPad to Mac,\\nAirPods to Apple Watch — we’ve never had a stronger lineup of products. And with services like Apple TV+, the App Store, Apple\\nMusic, Apple Pay, and many more, we’ve only expanded the potential and possibility Apple can bring — from helping people find\\nconnection, entertainment and joy, to empowering them to live healthier lives.\\n\\xa0\\nWe’ve done all of this while continuing to\\nlead with our values in everything we do. That’s why we’ve put our users’ fundamental right to privacy at the center\\nof everything we do, and continued innovating to protect it. We’ve built accessibility into every product we make from the ground\\nup, because we believe the best technology should be the best technology for everyone. And we’ve continued to push forward in our\\nwork to build an even more diverse and inclusive Apple, and to carry those values beyond our doors with our Racial Equity and Justice\\nInitiative.\\n\\xa0\\nOur teams are also pressing forward to meet the\\nchallenge of climate change. Our corporate operations have run on 100% renewable energy since 2018, and with our latest Apple Watch lineup,\\nwe’ve now launched our first-ever carbon neutral models. Thanks to milestones like these, we’re closer than ever to realizing\\nApple 2030 — our goal to become carbon neutral for our supply chain and the lifetime of our products by the end of the decade.\\n\\xa0\\nAs companies and individuals, our values give us\\npurpose, our goals give us direction, and our progress gives us hope. And at Apple, we’ll continue to innovate in the belief that\\n— with hope and hard work — there is nothing we can’t achieve.\\n\\xa0\\nOn behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to thank\\nour shareholders for the confidence they’ve shown in our company, and in the bright future that lies ahead.\\n\\xa0\\nTim Cook\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Values\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe are committed to demonstrating that business can and should be a force\\nfor good. Achieving that takes innovation, collaboration, and a focus on serving others. It also means leading with our values in the\\ntechnology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people and the planet we all share. We’re always working to leave the world better\\nthan we found it, and to create powerful tools that empower others to do the same.\\n\\xa0\\nAccessibility\\n\\xa0\\nWe build accessibility features into all of our products, because we\\nbelieve that technology should meet people where they are, not the other way around.\\n\\xa0\\nEducation\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe education is a great equalizing force and a powerful source\\nof opportunity for all.\\n\\xa0\\nEnvironment\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe doing right by the planet is good for people, for communities,\\nand for business.\\n\\xa0\\nInclusion\\xa0& Diversity\\n\\xa0\\nWe’re committed to making our Company more inclusive and diverse.\\n\\xa0\\nPrivacy\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe privacy is a fundamental human right.\\n\\xa0\\nRacial Equity and Justice\\n\\xa0\\nWe are all accountable for the urgent work of building a more just and\\nequitable world.\\n\\xa0\\nSupplier Responsibility\\n\\xa0\\nWe hold our suppliers to the highest standards for labor and human rights,\\nworking across our global supply chain to expand opportunity and empower people.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\nProgress Across our Values\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAt Apple, we see so many possibilities for technology to enrich people’s\\nlives. This year, leading with the values that have long guided our company, our teams have made those possibilities real. That included\\ncreating experiences that are customizable to the diverse needs of our users with new features for cognitive accessibility, along with\\nLiveSpeech, Personal Voice, and Point and Speak. We’ve also made key innovations in privacy\\xa0and safety\\xa0features to give\\nusers greater control of their data\\xa0and help protect children,\\xa0including\\xa0expanding Communication Safety\\xa0and launching\\nLink Tracking Protection and\\xa0Sensitive Content Warnings.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWe know that together, we can rise to our biggest challenges as a global\\ncommunity. And this year, we’ve made progress in empowering others to do better. We equipped students through additional coding\\neducation resources. We propelled entrepreneurs through investments with venture capital funds and financial institutions focused on getting\\ncapital to Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous-owned businesses, backing founders who have historically been cut out of funding opportunities.\\nAnd, we supported supplier employees through an additional $50 million commitment to our Supplier Employee Development Fund, designed\\nto strengthen and scale programs that support worker voice, rights training and education, and skill development opportunities.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe values we share at Apple inspire the work we share with everyone.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nSpotlight on Apple’s 2030 Goal\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWe set an ambitious goal —\\nto make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire supply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers’ devices.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\nReleased our first ever carbon neutral products\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nSecured commitment from over 300 of our suppliers to use 100%\\n    clean energy for Apple production by 2030\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nWelcomed our third impact accelerator class of diverse innovators\\n    on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nIntroduced a new tool, Grid Forecast, to help inform users\\n    when their power grid has cleaner energy available\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n•\\nIncreased recycled and renewable materials including:\\n\\xa0\\n•\\n100% recycled aluminum in the enclosures of our MacBooks, Apple\\n    TV Siri Remote, and Apple Watch\\n\\xa0\\n•\\n100% recycled cobalt in our\\n    iPhone 15, carbon neutral Apple Watch     Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 batteries\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nExpanded recycled gold, tin, and tungsten in our Apple Watch\\n    Series 9\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nA brand-new textile, FineWoven, made from 68% post-consumer\\n    recycled content, a step towards ending the use of leather across product lines\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWe share progress on our values through our websites,\\n  reports, and other public announcements.

We have a straightforward and effective executive\\ncompensation program that incorporates sound policies and best practices and delivers a majority of our named executive officers’\\ncompensation through incentives that are aligned with shareholder interests and Company performance.\\n\\xa0\\nAligned with Shareholder Interests and Company Performance\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n●\\nAnnual\\n        cash incentive opportunities are capped and have challenging performance goals tied to key measures of overall company performance\\n        and profitability.\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nPerformance-based RSUs generally vest based on Apple’s total shareholder return relative to companies in the S&P 500 over a three\\n        year-performance period.\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nShareholders\\n        have an opportunity to cast an advisory say on pay vote each year on the compensation of our named executive officers and indicated\\n        strong support for our executive compensation program at the 2023 Annual Meeting, including the 2023 changes to our CEO’s compensation,\\n        as described below.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2023 CEO Compensation Changes\\n\\xa0\\nThe People and Compensation\\nCommittee evaluates our executive compensation program each year. The results of the Say on Pay advisory vote at the 2022 Annual\\nMeeting led to broader shareholder engagement on executive compensation. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder\\nfeedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback\\nreceived. It then approved the target annual compensation of our named executive officers for 2023, including the following changes\\nto CEO compensation, which Mr. Cook supported, and which the People and Compensation Committee believes are responsive to shareholder\\nfeedback, while continuing to align pay with performance and recognize Mr. Cook’s outstanding leadership and the exceptional\\nlong-term results he delivers to shareholders.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTarget\\n    CEO Pay\\nMr.\\n    Cook’s 2023 target total compensation was $49 million, a reduction of over 40% from his 2022 target total compensation.\\n    Taking into consideration Apple’s comparative size, scope, and success, the People and Compensation Committee also intends\\n    to position Mr. Cook’s annual target compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles relative to our primary peer\\n    group for future years.\\n\\nCEO Equity Mix\\nThe\\n    portion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook was increased from 50% to 75% of\\n    his 2023 target equity award and the portion of his performance-based RSUs will be at least 75% of his target equity awards\\n    for future years.\\n\\nCEO Retirement\\n    Vesting\\nThe\\n    time-based RSUs awarded to Mr. Cook in 2023 provide for pro-rata instead of full vesting in the event of retirement during\\n    the term of the award and only if retirement occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. The People and Compensation\\n    Committee intends to maintain this same structure for future years.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information on our executive compensation program and the 2023 compensation of our named executive officers, see the section entitled “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 46.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNominees to Apple’s Board of Directors\\n\\xa0\\nApple is overseen by directors with diverse skills,\\nqualities, attributes, and experiences that effectively address the Company’s evolving needs and represent the best interests\\nof Apple’s shareholders.

Directors are expected to take a proactive, focused approach to ensure Apple is committed to\\nbusiness success through the maintenance of high standards of responsibility and ethics.\\n\\xa0\\nBoard Independence\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Corporate Governance Guidelines\\nrequire a majority of Board members to be independent. The Board has determined that all Board members and nominees, other than\\nMr.\\xa0Cook, are independent under applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market\\xa0LLC (“Nasdaq”).\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Board has a standing Audit\\nand Finance Committee (the “Audit Committee”), People and Compensation Committee (the “People and Compensation\\nCommittee”), and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “Nominating Committee”). The Board has determined\\nthat all committee members are independent under applicable Nasdaq and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules\\nfor committee memberships, and that each member of the Audit Committee also meets the additional independence criteria set forth\\nin Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\\n\\xa0\\nBoard and Committee Structure\\n\\xa0\\nApple regularly reviews the Board’s\\nleadership structure and the responsibilities and composition of its standing committees. The structure and composition of Apple’s\\nBoard and its committees are intended to leverage the diverse perspectives of the Board members and promote effective oversight.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Board believes its current leadership\\nstructure, in which the roles of Chair and CEO are separated, best serves Apple’s overall corporate structure and the Board’s\\nability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of Apple’s shareholders, including its oversight of management\\nand corporate governance matters.

Apple identifies salient human rights risks through internal risk assessments and external industry-level third-party audits. Additionally, the policy requires Apple to maintain active communication channels\\n        with rights holders and other stakeholders. The Board is responsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing\\n        our Human Rights Policy.

In establishing and reviewing Apple’s compensation programs for risk, the People\\n        and Compensation Committee considers program features that mitigate against potential risks for our executive\\n        officers, such as fixed base salaries; goals that are tied to specific company financial measures and payout\\n        caps for the annual cash incentive program; clawbacks for our cash and equity incentives; the quantity and\\n        mix of long-term performance-based and time-based equity incentives; and stock ownership requirements.\\n        The People and Compensation Committee also generally considers the program features that mitigate\\n        potential risks for our non-executive officer employees.

In evaluating potential nominees to the Board, the Nominating Committee\\nconsiders, among other things: independence, character, ability to exercise sound judgment, demonstrated leadership, ability and\\nwillingness to commit sufficient time to the Board, and relevant skills and experience in the context of the Board’s evolving\\nneeds. The Nominating Committee also considers the diversity of the Board overall with respect to age, disability, gender identity\\nor expression, ethnicity, military veteran status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, and other backgrounds and\\nexperiences. The Nominating Committee is committed to actively seeking out, and will instruct any search firm it engages to identify,\\nindividuals who will contribute to the overall diversity of the Board to be included in the pool of candidates from which nominees\\nto the Board are selected. 63% of nominees self-identify as women or members of an underrepresented community, and 50% of Board\\nleadership positions are held by women. The Board monitors the mix of skills and experience of its directors to help ensure it\\nhas the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively. The Nominating Committee, with the assistance of an outside\\nsearch firm, and input from our independent directors, Chair of the Board, and CEO, identified Wanda Austin as a potential candidate\\nand recommended her to the Board.\\n\\xa0\\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines require\\nan annual review by the Nominating Committee of each director’s various time commitments, including their primary occupation,\\nservice on other public company boards and board committees, leadership positions on other boards, as well as service with private\\ncompany boards and non-profit organizations. Following its review in 2023, the Nominating Committee has determined that, in its\\nview, no director currently has time commitments that would prevent them from properly discharging their duties as directors.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Nominating Committee evaluates candidates\\nrecommended by shareholders using the same criteria it applies to evaluate other candidates. Shareholders who wish to recommend\\na director candidate should submit the candidate’s name and background information in writing to our Secretary at One Apple\\nPark Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA. In addition, the proxy access provisions in our bylaws provide that a shareholder,\\nor a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares continuously for at least three years, may nominate\\ndirector nominees constituting up to 20% of Apple’s Board for inclusion in our proxy statement. Nominating shareholders and\\nnominees must satisfy the requirements set forth in our bylaws, which can be found at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance.\\nAny notice of director nomination submitted to Apple other than through proxy access must include the additional information required\\nby Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Nominating Committee has evaluated and\\nrecommended to the full Board each of the nominees named in this Proxy Statement for election to the Board.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n32\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNominees for Election\\n\\xa0\\nThe following biographical disclosures only\\ninclude information regarding nominees for election or reelection at the Annual Meeting.

In 2023,\\nthe Chair of the Board, Dr. Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $175,000; the Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr.\\nSugar, received an additional cash retainer of $37,500; the Chair of the People and Compensation Committee, Ms. Jung,\\nreceived an additional cash retainer of $32,500; and the Chair of the Nominating Committee, Ms. Wagner, received an\\nadditional cash retainer of $27,500. All retainers are paid in quarterly installments.\\n\\xa0\\nEquity-Based Awards\\n\\xa0\\nA substantial portion of each Non-Employee\\nDirector’s annual retainer is in the form of equity awards. Under the Director Stock Plan, Non-Employee Directors are granted\\nrestricted stock units (“RSUs”) on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders (each, an “Annual Director Award”). All Annual Director Awards\\nvest on February 1 of the following year, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date. For 2023, the number\\nof RSUs underlying each Annual Director Award was 1,852, which was determined by dividing $275,000 by the per share closing price\\nof Apple’s common stock on the date of grant.\\n\\xa0\\nA Non-Employee Director who is newly appointed\\nto the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders will receive a grant of RSUs upon appointment (an\\n“Initial Director Award”), except that a Non-Employee Director who first joins the Board on or after February 1 of\\na particular year and prior to the annual meeting for that year, or a director who was an employee of Apple immediately prior to\\nfirst becoming a Non-Employee Director, will not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each Initial\\nDirector Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the award is pro-rated based\\non the portion of the vesting period that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards are scheduled to vest\\non the next February 1 following the grant of the award.\\n\\xa0\\nEach RSU award granted under the Director\\nStock Plan is credited with an amount equal to any ordinary dividend paid by Apple, multiplied by the total number of RSUs subject\\nto the award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for the dividend. The amounts credited to each RSU are referred\\nto as “dividend equivalents.” Any dividend equivalents credited to RSUs granted under the Director Stock Plan will\\nbe subject to the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate. The\\ndividend equivalents are meant to treat the RSU award holders consistently with shareholders.\\n\\xa0\\nEquipment and Other\\nBusiness-Related Programs\\n\\xa0\\nApple has an equipment program for the Board\\nunder which each Non-Employee Director is eligible to receive, upon request and free of charge, one of each new product introduced\\nby Apple, and is eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Each Non-Employee Director is also eligible to participate\\nin Apple’s matching gifts program to the same extent as Apple employees.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDeferred Compensation Plan\\n\\xa0\\nWe maintain the Apple Inc.

None of\\nour other Non-Employee Directors deferred compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2023.\\n\\xa0\\nStock Ownership Guidelines\\n\\xa0\\nApple has stock ownership guidelines for our CEO, executive officers,\\nand Non-Employee Directors. Under the guidelines, each Non-Employee Director is expected, within five years after joining the Board,\\nto own shares of Apple’s common stock that have a value equal to five times their annual cash retainer for serving as a director.\\nShares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with, or separately by, the individual’s spouse, or held in\\ntrust for the benefit of the individual, the individual’s spouse, or the individual’s children.

Behind every innovation, there are so many talented teams who collaborate to create incredible products\\nand services for Apple users around the world. And following the expansion of our charter in 2023, the People and Compensation Committee\\nwill do even more to support Apple’s teams — including oversight of our investments in employee engagement, inclusion and\\ndiversity, talent recruitment, development, and retention.\\n\\xa0\\nOf course, Apple’s leadership plays a\\nkey role in fostering a culture of collaboration — driving innovation and charting a course for the future. Our\\nexecutive compensation program aims to reflect these important contributions, from leaders whose vision is so essential to\\nApple’s continued success. It also reflects feedback from our shareholders — which is an important consideration\\nevery year as we evaluate the compensation of our executive officers.\\n\\xa0\\nThat includes our Chief Executive Officer\\n— Tim Cook — whose outstanding leadership has been crucial to Apple’s success and its enduring track record\\nof innovation. Tim continues to distinguish himself as a responsible, thoughtful, and visionary leader guiding Apple. Under\\nhis leadership, the company continues to empower people with innovative technology, while staying true to the values and the\\nspirit of ingenuity that have long guided its work, and over the past three years, Apple’s total shareholder return is\\nmore than 55% — nearly 20% above the S&P 500.\\n\\xa0\\nAs a committee, we have a responsibility to\\nensure that the compensation of our CEO reflects the success of our Company and the excellence of its leadership. Last year,\\nour committee shared its intention to set Tim’s compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles of target CEO pay at\\nour primary peer companies, and 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of\\nApple’s executive compensation program. We believe positioning Tim’s compensation at this level is responsive to\\nshareholder feedback and appropriate given Apple’s relative size and scope compared to our peer companies.\\n\\xa0\\nAs we look ahead, we’re grateful\\nto our community of shareholders for their engagement, which will continue to shape the future of our executive\\ncompensation program. And together, we’ll continue to support the success of Apple’s teams, its leaders, and its\\nvital work to create technology that empowers people and enriches their lives.\\n\\xa0\\nSincerely,\\n\\xa0\\nAndrea Jung \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Al Gore \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Alex Gorsky \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Art\\nLevinson\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis\\n        Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) explains the guiding principles,\\n        policies, and practices upon which our executive compensation program is based, and the 2023 compensation paid to our named\\n        executive officers.\\n\\xa0\\nSummary of 2023 Named Executive Officer Compensation\\n\\xa0\\nMotivating and retaining a talented and\\nexperienced leadership team is a key factor in Apple’s long-term success. We have a consistent and effective executive\\ncompensation program that incorporates sound policies and best practices. We also believe that the compensation of our named\\nexecutive officers should reflect the strength of our financial results and our commitment to values-driven leadership. The\\ncompensation paid to our executive officers in 2023 aligns with the continued strength of our financial results in an uneven\\nmacroeconomic environment and the significant progress made across our core values and key community initiatives. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe vast majority of our named executive officers’ compensation\\nis delivered through long-term equity awards. The performance-based equity awards that vested in 2023 reflected Apple’s exceptional\\nstock price performance for the three fiscal year period from the start of 2020 through the end of 2022. Apple’s total shareholder return\\nrelative to other companies in the S&P 500 (“Relative TSR”) was at the 98th percentile for this performance period. As\\na result, in 2023 each of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook who did not have a performance-based RSU award scheduled to\\nvest in 2023, vested in the maximum number of performance-based RSUs.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOur 2023 Named\\nExecutive Officers\\n\\xa0\\nTim Cook\\nChief Executive Officer\\n\\xa0\\nLuca Maestri\\nSenior Vice President, \\nChief Financial Officer\\n\\xa0\\nKate Adams\\nSenior Vice President, \\nGeneral Counsel and Secretary\\n\\xa0\\nDeirdre O’Brien\\nSenior Vice President, Retail\\n\\xa0\\nJeff Williams\\nChief Operating Officer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor 2023, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion\\nand operating income results of $114.3 billion. \\xa0Each of our named executive officers also received a 2023 cash incentive award\\nbased on the achievement of annual net sales and operating income performance goals and progress made in furtherance of\\nApple’s values and key community initiatives. Achievement against the net sales and operating income performance goals resulted in a payout opportunity of 166.1%.The\\nPeople and Compensation Committee also recognized the significant results delivered and progress made in 2023 in furtherance of our\\nvalues and key community initiatives and applied a 7.5% modifier to the payout opportunity for a final Cash Incentive Plan payout of\\n178.6% of target for each of our named executive officers.\\n\\xa0\\nSay on Pay Advisory Vote Results\\n\\xa0\\nFollowing the 2022 Annual Meeting, Apple\\nengaged with a significant number of our largest shareholders to discuss their perspectives with respect to our executive\\ncompensation program and CEO pay. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder feedback, Apple’s\\nexceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received and\\nmade significant changes that are reflected in the amount and structure of Mr. Cook’s 2023 compensation. 89% of votes\\ncast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation program. We\\nbelieve the 2023 Say on Pay advisory vote reflects the expanded shareholder engagement efforts, and the positive shareholder\\nresponse to the overall structure of our executive compensation program and the changes to Mr. Cook’s 2023 total target\\ncompensation. Mr.\\xa0Cook’s 2023 total target compensation is further described in “CEO Compensation,”\\nbelow.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n47\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExecutive Compensation Policies and Practices\\n\\xa0\\nWe are committed to sound executive\\ncompensation policies and practices, as highlighted in the following table.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nProhibition on hedging, pledging, and short sales\\n\\xa0\\nWe prohibit short sales, transactions in derivatives, hedging, and pledging of Apple securities by our named executive officers.\\n\\nStock ownership guidelines\\n\\xa0\\nWe have robust stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers, including a ten times annual base salary requirement for our CEO.\\n\\nCompensation recoupment\\n\\xa0\\nWe have recoupment provisions that comply with the new SEC rules and Nasdaq Listing Standards for our Section 16 officers for the recovery of any erroneously awarded performance-based incentive compensation. \\xa0We also maintain a discretionary recoupment policy applicable to our named executive officers and our broader executive team that allows for recovery of annual cash incentives, equity awards, or other amounts that may be paid with respect to awards in certain events, including for certain acts of misconduct by our named executive officers.\\n\\nNo repricing\\n\\xa0\\nWe do not allow repricing of stock options without shareholder approval.\\n\\nNo tax gross-ups on perquisites\\n\\xa0\\nWe do not provide tax gross-ups for the limited types of perquisites provided to our named executive officers.

Our clear guiding\\nprinciples and sound compensation policies and practices align the pay of our named executive officers with Company performance, taking\\ninto consideration the size, scope, and success of Apple’s business.\\n\\xa0\\nTeam-Based Approach\\nWe apply a unique team-based approach to the compensation\\nof our named executive officers to emphasize their shared responsibility for Apple’s overall success. This approach recognizes the\\nexceptional experience, leadership, and value each of our named executive officers contributes to Apple’s leadership team, with\\nCEO compensation awarded at a higher level to reflect the additional scope and complexity of that role.\\n\\xa0\\nPerformance Expectations\\nThe vast majority of our executive pay is tied to performance\\nto ensure alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders. We establish clear, quantitative financial goals and values-driven performance\\nexpectations for our named executive officers each year that focus on Apple’s overall success.\\n\\xa0\\nEmphasis on Long-Term Equity Awards\\nWe emphasize long-term\\nperformance, retention, and alignment between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders by\\nsignificantly weighting our named executive officers’ compensation towards long-term equity awards. Performance-based\\nRSUs reward long-term out-performance relative to other companies. Time-based RSUs are also an important component of\\nlong-term equity awards because they promote stability and retention of an exceptional leadership team.\\n\\xa0\\nExecutive Compensation Decision-Making Process\\n\\xa0\\nSetting appropriate compensation for our named executive\\nofficers is a core responsibility of the People and Compensation Committee.\\xa0The People and Compensation Committee consists entirely\\nof independent directors who review and approve the compensation of Apple’s named executive officers each year. \\xa0It also administers\\nApple’s employee equity compensation plans.

To make this determination, the People and Compensation Committee will review with its\\nindependent compensation consultant the target annual total compensation opportunity provided to the CEOs in Apple’s\\nprimary peer group using the then available public filings for each of the companies. Apple remains significantly larger than\\nmost other companies and the People and Compensation Committee does not otherwise set compensation components for its named\\nexecutive officers to meet specific benchmarks as compared to peer companies.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRevenue shown is based on the trailing 12 months revenue\\nfor Apple and each of our primary peers ending closest to our 2023 fiscal year-end. Market capitalization for our primary peers is the\\namount reported by Bloomberg L.P. as of September 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023.\\n\\xa0\\nOur primary peer group consists of large\\nU.S.-based, stand-alone, publicly traded companies in the technology, media, and internet services industries that, in the\\nPeople and Compensation Committee’s view, compete with Apple for talent. The threshold revenue and market\\ncapitalization requirements for a company to be considered for the primary peer group for 2023 were $20 billion and $100\\nbillion, respectively at the time the 2023 peer group was set. Based on the above criteria, the People and Compensation\\nCommittee removed Charter Communications and IBM and added Mastercard Incorporated, Tesla, Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery,\\nInc. to the primary peer group for 2023. The 2023 primary group includes Alphabet, Amazon, AT&T, Cisco, Comcast, Disney,\\nIntel, Mastercard, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, Qualcomm, Salesforce, Tesla, Verizon, Visa, and Warner Bros.\\nDiscovery.\\n\\xa0\\nA secondary peer group of companies that have\\niconic brands or are industry or category leaders, rely on significant research and development, and innovation for growth, and\\nrequire highly-skilled employees has been developed as an additional reference set, primarily to compare pay practices. The 2023\\nsecondary peer group includes 3M, AbbVie, The Coca-Cola Company, Johnson\\xa0& Johnson, Nike, PepsiCo,\\nPfizer, Procter\\xa0& Gamble, Starbucks, and UnitedHealth Group.\\n\\xa0\\nAs shown in the chart above, Apple remains\\nconsiderably larger than the typical company in the primary peer group. \\xa0Apple has approximately four times the revenue and\\napproximately twelve times the market capitalization of the median peer companies in its primary peer group.

Mr. Cook is not present during People and Compensation Committee voting or deliberations regarding his own compensation.\\n\\xa0\\nComponents of Named Executive Officer Compensation\\n\\xa0\\nThe target total compensation of our named executive\\nofficers has three basic components: annual base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAnnual Base Salary\\n\\xa0\\nBase salary is a customary, fixed element of compensation\\nintended to attract and retain executives. When setting the annual base salaries of our named executive officers, the People and Compensation\\nCommittee considers market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, and Apple’s financial performance and size\\nrelative to peer companies. The annual base salaries for our named executive officers did not change for 2023.\\n\\xa0\\nAnnual Cash Incentive\\n\\xa0\\nOur annual cash incentive program is a performance-based, at-risk component of our named executive officers’ compensation. Cash incentive awards are granted under the Apple Inc.\\nExecutive Cash Incentive Plan (the “Cash Incentive Plan”). Variable payouts are designed to motivate our named executive\\nofficers to deliver strong annual financial results, while advancing Apple values and key community initiatives. The structure and\\npayout opportunities under the Cash Incentive Plan did not change for 2023. Additional details regarding the Cash Incentive Plan for\\n2023 can be found below in the section entitled “Cash Incentive Plan- 2023 Financial Performance Measures and Payout\\nOpportunities.”\\n\\xa0\\nLong-Term Equity Awards\\n\\xa0\\nWe pay for performance and manage Apple for the long-term. Consistent with this approach and our guiding compensation principles, the vast majority of our named executive officers’\\nannual compensation is granted in the form of long-term equity incentives that emphasize long-term shareholder value creation and the\\nretention of a strong executive leadership team through a mix of performance-based and time-based RSU awards. Additional details regarding\\nthese awards and the performance-based RSUs that vested in 2023 can be found below in the section entitled “2023 Long-Term Equity\\nAwards and Results.”\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n52\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSummary of CEO Compensation\\n\\xa0\\nThe People and Compensation\\nCommittee evaluates our executive compensation program and the total target value of Mr. Cook’s compensation prior to\\nthe start of each fiscal year. In determining the appropriate amount of each compensation component for 2023, the People\\nand Compensation Committee considered numerous factors with the Board and its independent compensation consultant, including\\nMr. Cook’s outstanding leadership, the immense scope and complexity of his role as Apple’s CEO, the\\nBoard’s confidence in his long-term strategic decisions, the Company’s financial results delivered during 2022,\\nand shareholder feedback. Balancing this feedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, a desire to continue to create\\nmeaningful performance and retention incentives, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of\\nthe feedback received, the People and Compensation Committee reduced his 2023 target equity award value while increasing the\\nportion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook from 50% to 75%. Given Apple’s significantly larger size and\\nscope, as compared to its primary peer companies, as well as Mr. Cook’s history of delivering exceptional results, the\\nPeople and Compensation Committee also intends to position his future total target compensation, commensurate with these\\nfactors, between the 80th and 90th percentiles of CEO total target compensation in our primary peer group.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTim\\n                                            Cook\\nChief Executive Officer\\nRole: 12 years\\nApple Tenure: 25 years\\n2023\\n                                            Total Target Compensation: $49\\xa0million\\nBase Salary:\\xa0$3\\xa0million\\nMr. Cook’s base salary has remained the same since 2016\\n\\xa0\\nCash Incentive Plan Opportunity:\\xa0$6\\xa0million\\nMr. Cook’s\\ntarget Cash Incentive Plan opportunity for 2023 remained at 200% of his base salary\\n\\xa0\\nTarget Equity Award Value:\\xa0$40\\xa0million\\nAward Mix:\\xa075/25\\nMr. Cook was granted an equity award with 75% of the\\nequity award subject to performance-based vesting and\\xa025% of the equity award subject to time-based vesting\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCEO Equity Awards\\n\\xa0\\nEquity awards granted to Mr. Cook are\\nintended to create meaningful equity incentives aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The People and\\nCompensation Committee recognizes the growth and success Mr. Cook has delivered to shareholders for more than a decade as\\nCEO, and the impact of his leadership is evident in the Company’s short-term and long-term success. The amount and\\nstructure of Mr. Cook’s equity awards are intended to align with our philosophy of managing Apple for the long term and\\ncreate incentives to drive continued success.\\n\\xa0\\nMr. Cook’s first RSU award as CEO in\\n2011 had a unique 10-year structure (the “2011 Award”). As the final vesting tranches of the 2011 Award\\napproached, the People and Compensation Committee evaluated Mr.\\xa0Cook’s equity compensation structure in light of\\nthe rapid growth and unparalleled success that Apple had achieved under Mr.\\xa0Cook’s leadership. The People and\\nCompensation Committee also considered the strong compensation structure and practices that had developed for our other named\\nexecutive officers, and the differences that had developed between the structure of Mr.\\xa0Cook’s long-term equity\\nincentives and the long-term equity incentives awarded to our other named executive officers annually since 2014. Taking\\nthese factors into consideration, Mr. Cook was granted an equity award in 2021 for the first time since he was promoted to\\nCEO and a second award, identical in amount and structure, was granted for 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n53\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn 2023, Mr. Cook was granted an equity\\naward with a total target equity grant value of $40 million (“2023 Equity Award”), a reduction in value of almost\\n40% from his 2022 target equity grant value. The 2023 Equity Award was specifically designed to continue to align pay with\\nperformance and shareholder interests and recognize Mr. Cook’s outstanding leadership. \\xa0It was further designed to\\nbalance shareholder feedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, a desire to continue to create meaningful performance\\nand retention incentives, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received.\\nThe People and Compensation Committee also changed the mix of the 2023 Equity Award to increase the performance-based portion\\nof the award from 50% to 75% and reduce the time-based portion of the award from 50% to 25%. \\xa0The portion of his\\nperformance-based RSUs will also be at least 75% for future years. The People and Compensation Committee believes these\\nchanges are responsive to shareholder feedback and meet the other objectives it considered for Mr. Cook’s compensation,\\nas noted above.\\n\\xa0\\nAlignment with Shareholder Value Creation\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe majority of Mr.\\nCook’s compensation has been delivered through long-term equity awards since his promotion to CEO in 2011. The equity\\nawards he has received align with Apple’s growth and success and the tremendous value delivered to our shareholders\\nunder his leadership. As of the end of 2023, Apple’s Relative TSR increased approximately 1,402% during Mr.\\nCook’s tenure as CEO, significantly outpacing the S&P 500 which increased approximately 360% over the same time\\nperiod. Apple’s market capitalization also grew by more than $2 trillion during Mr. Cook’s tenure as\\nCEO.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2024 CEO Total Target Compensation\\n\\xa0\\nWhen evaluating our executive compensation program and\\nthe total target value of Mr. Cook’s compensation for 2024, the People and Compensation Committee considered Mr. Cook’s continued\\nexceptional performance as CEO, the Company’s strong financial performance in an uneven macroeconomic environment, and shareholder\\nfeedback. Upon review of the relevant benchmark data with its independent compensation consultant the People and Compensation Committee\\nincreased the target value of Mr. Cook’s equity award for 2024 to $50 million, which, along with his base salary and target Cash Incentive\\nPlan award, positions his 2024 total target compensation within the 80th to 90th percentile of CEO pay at the companies in our primary\\npeer group. The People and Compensation Committee maintained the same equity award structure and weightings with 75% of the equity award\\nsubject to performance-based vesting and\\xa025% of the equity award subject to time-based vesting. \\xa0No changes were made to the\\namount of Mr. Cook’s base salary or the 2024 target payout opportunity under the Cash Incentive Plan.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n54\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSummary of Other Named Executive Officer Compensation\\n\\xa0\\nThe total target compensation of our four other named\\nexecutive officers similarly reflects the three basic components of our executive compensation program in a straightforward and effective\\nway.\\n\\xa0\\nTaking into account individual and company\\nperformance, as well as shareholder feedback which has consistently\\xa0confirmed support for the amount and structure of\\nour other named executive officers’ compensation, the People and Compensation Committee decided to maintain the same\\nlevel of base salary, Cash Incentive Plan opportunity, and equity award value for each of our named executive officers for\\n2023.

As in prior years, the People and Compensation Committee chose net sales and operating income, calculated in accordance\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, as the financial performance measures for the 2023 Cash Incentive Plan awards. Net sales\\nand operating income continue to reflect commonly recognized key measures of overall company performance and profitability and are drivers\\nof shareholder value creation.\\n\\xa0\\nPayouts for our named executive officers under the\\nCash Incentive Plan are first determined quantitatively based on an equal weighting of the net sales and operating income\\nperformance measures. The target payout opportunity for each of the net sales and operating income performance measures is 100% of\\nannual base salary for our named executive officers. Threshold performance results in a payout equal to 50% of target and maximum\\nperformance results in a payout equal to 200% of target for each of the performance measures. If the threshold goal is not achieved\\nfor a financial performance measure, there is no payout for that measure and the total payout opportunity for each financial\\nperformance measure is capped at 200%. Payouts for our named executive officers are linearly interpolated for achievement between\\ngoal levels.\\n\\xa0\\nThe People and Compensation Committee primarily considers\\nfactors relevant to the current fiscal year when it sets the net sales and operating income goals for the annual Cash Incentive Plan awards\\nbecause each year presents a unique set of challenges and business conditions for our executives to navigate. Financial results from prior\\nyears are used as a reference point, but the annual goals are set primarily to align pay with performance that reflects strong financial\\nresults commensurate with the projected business and economic conditions for the current fiscal year.\\n\\xa0\\n2023 Financial Performance Goals and Results\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAs part of its goal-setting process for\\n2023, the People and Compensation Committee considered the likelihood of a range of business scenarios that could impact net\\nsales and operating income results for the year taking into account several factors. These factors included anticipated\\nforeign currency headwinds, the ongoing uneven macroeconomic environment and the continuing effects of the prolonged\\nuncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic including, country-specific policies and lockdowns. Accordingly, the People and\\nCompensation Committee determined that focusing on the underlying business performance was an appropriate method of\\nevaluating the 2023 performance goals. The Committee believed that attaining similar underlying performance to 2022’s\\nrecord-breaking net sales and operating income results would require a high level of performance given these factors, and set\\nthe target goals at this level.\\n\\xa0\\nFor 2023, the Company’s total net\\nsales decreased 3%. However, the weakness in foreign exchange relative to the US dollar accounted for more than the entire\\nyear-over-year decrease in total net sales. On an underlying basis, the company delivered strong performance in a challenging\\nenvironment driven by all-time high revenue records in emerging markets, and we achieved an all-time revenue record in\\nServices. The Company was also thoughtful and deliberate on spending while driving cost and gross margins improvements\\nthroughout the year. \\xa0Overall, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion and operating income of $114.3 billion. These\\nachievements resulted in 153.1% and 179.1% target payout opportunities, respectively, for an aggregate payout opportunity of\\n166.1% prior to application of the modifier described below.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAnnual Assessment of Apple Values and Key Community Initiatives\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe that our business can and should\\nbe a force for good.

After the People and Compensation Committee\\ndetermines the preliminary payout opportunity based on our net sales and operating income performance measures, it may choose\\nto apply a modifier to the preliminary payout opportunity of up to 10%, upwards or downwards, or determine not to make any\\nadjustment at all. The Cash Incentive Plan award is subject to an overall cap on each of the named executive officers’\\npayout of 200% of the total target payout opportunity, regardless of the results of the People and Compensation\\nCommittee’s values assessment.\\n\\xa0\\nFor 2023, the People and Compensation\\nCommittee reviewed with management an extensive scorecard for each Apple value and key community initiative to inform its\\noverall values assessment. Each scorecard included a long-term vision, 2023 areas of focus, highlights, including qualitative\\nand quantitative data to measure progress, areas of opportunity, and management’s assessment of our overall progress to\\nadvance each value and key community initiative. Based on its discussions with management and overall evaluation of the Apple\\nvalues scorecard presented for the year, the People and Compensation Committee recognized the significant progress achieved\\nas represented by the select highlights below, while also recognizing the areas of opportunity, and applied a modifier of\\n7.5% out of the maximum of 10%.\\n\\xa0\\nScorecard Focus and

Cash Incentive Plan Payouts\\n\\xa0\\nOur 2023 net sales and operating income attainment resulted\\nin a net sales payout opportunity of 153.1% of target and an operating income payout opportunity of 179.1% of target for an aggregate\\npayout opportunity of 166.1% of target. The People and Compensation Committee recognized the significant progress achieved in furtherance\\nof our values and key community initiatives and applied a modifier of 7.5% out of the maximum of 10% resulting in a final Cash Incentive\\nPlan award for 2023 of 178.6% of the target payout opportunity for each of our named executive officers in 2023.\\n\\xa0\\n2023 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results\\n\\xa0\\nWhen setting the value of equity awards for our named\\nexecutive officers, the People and Compensation Committee considers the size and performance of Apple relative to peer companies, and\\nthe scope of our named executive officers’ roles. Each named executive officer other than Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity\\naward on September 25, 2022 of 50% performance-based and 50% time-based RSUs. Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity award on September\\n25, 2022 of 75% performance-based and 25% time-based RSUs.\\n\\xa0\\n2023 Time-Based RSUs\\n\\xa0\\nEquity awards with time-based vesting align the interests\\nof our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive\\nteam over the longer term. Vesting schedules for time-based RSUs are generally longer than our peer companies.\\n\\xa0\\nTime-based RSUs granted to our named\\nexecutive officers on September 25, 2022, will vest in three equal annual installments over approximately four and one-half\\nyears, with the first installment vesting on April 1, 2025 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date),\\nsubject to the award agreements. The number of time-based RSUs granted to each named executive officer was determined by\\ndividing the target value of $10 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for these\\nRSUs is reported in the “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021.”\\n\\xa0\\n2023 Performance-Based RSUs\\n\\xa0\\nThe People and Compensation Committee continued to use\\nRelative TSR as the metric for performance-based RSUs with the S&P 500 as the comparative group because it continues to be an objective\\nand meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and aligns the interests of our named\\nexecutive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value.\\n\\xa0\\nPerformance-based RSUs are a\\nsubstantial, at-risk component of our named executive officers’ compensation tied to Apple’s long-term\\nperformance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest, if any, depends entirely on Relative TSR for the applicable\\nperformance period. To earn the target number of performance-based RSUs, Apple must achieve above-median performance at the\\n55th percentile of the S&P 500. We measure Relative TSR for the applicable performance period based on the change in each\\ncompany’s stock price during the applicable performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that\\nperiod, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. We use a 20-trading-day averaging period to determine the beginning\\nand ending stock price to calculate the TSR of Apple and each company in the S&P 500. This averaging period mitigates the\\nimpact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the\\nperformance period. For each company, the change in stock price from the beginning to the end of the performance period is\\ndivided by the beginning stock price to determine TSR.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n59\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe performance-based RSUs granted\\non September 25, 2022, have a three-fiscal-year performance period from the beginning of 2023 through the end of 2025.\\nSubject to the terms of the award agreements, between zero and 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs will vest\\non October 1, 2025, depending on Apple’s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the performance period, as follows:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRelative TSR Percentile v.\\nS&P\\xa0500 Companies\\nPerformance-Based RSUs\\nVesting as a Percentage of Target\\n\\n85th\\xa0Percentile or above\\n200%\\n\\n55th\\xa0Percentile\\n100%\\n\\n25th\\xa0Percentile\\n25%\\n\\nBelow 25th\\n0%\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf Apple’s TSR for the performance\\nperiod is negative, the number of performance-based RSUs that vest will be capped at 100% of the target regardless of our\\npercentile ranking. If Apple’s Relative TSR percentile ranking is above the 25th percentile and between the other\\nlevels shown in the table above, the portion of the performance-based RSUs that vest will be linearly interpolated between\\nthe two nearest vesting percentages.\\n\\xa0\\nThe target number of performance-based RSUs granted\\nto Mr. Cook was determined by dividing the target value of $30 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The target number\\nof performance-based RSUs granted to Ms. Adams, Mr.\\xa0Maestri, Ms.\\xa0O’Brien, and Mr.\\xa0Williams was determined by dividing\\nthe target value of $10 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant.

Items or services provided to our named executive officers that may be considered perquisites are\\nlimited,\\xa0as discussed below and reported in “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021.”\\n\\xa0\\nDeferred Compensation Plan\\nOur named executive officers are eligible to defer a\\nportion of their base salary and ther annual Cash Incentive Plan payout opportunity under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan.\\n\\xa0\\nOther Personal Benefits\\nWe provide risk-based,\\nbusiness-related, and personal security services for our employees, including our named executive officers, as determined to\\nbe appropriate by our security team. We consider the security measures provided to our named executive officers to be\\nreasonable and necessary expenses for the benefit of Apple and not a personal benefit. In the interests of security and\\nefficiency based on our global profile and the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook’s role as CEO, the Board also requires\\nthat Mr. Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. Mr. Cook recognizes imputed taxable income and is\\nnot provided a tax reimbursement for personal use of private aircraft. On occasion, our named executive officers, and\\npersonal guests, may attend company-sponsored or business-related entertainment events. Although their attendance serves a\\nbusiness purpose, it may not be directly related to their role and responsibilities. As a result, our named executive\\nofficers may recognize imputed taxable income related to their attendance at such events depending on their respective roles\\nand responsibilities and we do not provide an associated tax reimbursement or gross-up. In accordance with SEC disclosure\\nrules, the aggregate incremental costs associated with these activities is reported in the “Summary Compensation\\nTable—2023, 2022, and 2021.”\\n\\xa0\\nCompensation Upon Termination of Employment\\nOur named executive officers do not have employment\\ncontracts or guaranteed cash severance arrangements and are not entitled to acceleration of their equity awards or any other payments\\nupon a change in control.\\n\\xa0\\nThe time-based RSU award agreements for all\\nour employees, including Mr. Cook, provide for full accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death. The time-based RSU\\nagreements for all our employees, other than Mr. Cook, provide for pro-rata accelerated vesting upon a termination due to\\ndisability. The performance-based RSU award agreements for our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook, provide for\\npro-rata accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death or disability. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe time and performance-based RSU\\nagreements for Mr. Cook provide for full vesting upon a termination due to disability with settlement occurring on the\\noriginally scheduled vesting dates. The People and Compensation Committee also approved a retirement vesting provision in Mr.\\nCook’s outstanding equity awards to recognize the unique impact of his leadership decisions on the long-term growth and\\nsuccess of Apple. Retirement is defined as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years of age and completing\\nat least 10 years of service with Apple. Mr. Cook has met these requirements. The People and Compensation Committee\\nconsidered shareholder feedback provided in recent engagements that the primary purpose of time-based RSUs should be\\nretention. Thus, while treatment in the event of death or disability remained unchanged, Mr. Cook’s 2023\\ntime-based RSUs were structured to vest on a pro rata basis, based on the dates of employment, in the event of his\\ntermination due to retirement on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Unless otherwise determined by the People\\nand Compensation Committee, Mr. Cook’s outstanding performance-based RSU agreements provide for a continued right to\\nreceive the full number of earned shares underlying the performance-based RSUs on the original vesting dates upon a\\ntermination due to death, disability, or termination of employment due to retirement that occurs on or after the first\\nanniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook retires on or after the first anniversary of the grant date, the shares underlying\\nhis RSU awards will be released on the original vesting date, subject to the attainment of the performance goals for the\\nperformance-based RSUs. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook’s equity awards and any dividend\\nequivalents that have accrued on such awards are not accelerated upon retirement.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n61\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGovernance and Other Considerations\\n\\xa0\\nRecoupment of Compensation\\nThe terms of all outstanding RSU awards held by our\\nnamed executive officers in 2023 allow us to recoup any shares or other amount that may be paid in respect of RSUs in the event the named\\nexecutive officer engages in certain acts of misconduct. The compensation recoupment policy also applies to the awards and payout opportunities\\ngranted under the Cash Incentive Plan to our executive officers. Apple may recover compensation in the event a named executive officer\\ncommits a felony while employed by Apple or, while employed by Apple or at any time thereafter, a named executive officer engages in a\\nbreach of confidentiality; materially breaches any agreement with Apple; commits an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud; or if Apple is\\nrequired to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of the named executive officer’s misconduct. Apple also adopted additional\\nrecoupment provisions in 2024 in accordance with the SEC rules and Nasdaq Listing Standards effective on October 2, 2023, which mandate\\nthe recovery of certain erroneously paid performance-based incentive compensation that may be received by our Section 16 officers on or\\nafter October 2, 2023, if Apple has a qualifying financial restatement during the three completed fiscal years immediately prior to the\\nfiscal year in which a financial restatement determination is made, subject to limited exceptions.\\n\\xa0\\nProhibition on Hedging, Pledging, and Short Sales\\nWe prohibit short sales, hedging,\\nand transactions in derivatives of Apple securities for all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees,\\nindependent contractors, and consultants. In addition, we prohibit pledging of Apple stock as collateral by directors and\\nexecutive officers of Apple. We allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange\\nfunds.\\n\\xa0\\nStock Ownership Guidelines\\nUnder our stock ownership guidelines, Mr.\\nCook is expected to own shares of Apple stock that have a value equal to 10 times his annual base salary. All other executive\\nofficers are expected to own shares that have a value equal to three times their annual base salary within five years of the\\nofficer first becoming subject to the guidelines.

The threshold, target, and maximum payout amounts\\n    for each named executive officer’s Cash Incentive Plan payout opportunity for 2023 are shown in the table entitled “Grants\\n    of Plan-Based Awards—2023.” In 2023, Apple’s performance exceeded the target performance goals for both net sales\\n    and operating income, resulting in a preliminary payout of 166.1% of the total target payout opportunity for each named executive\\n    officer. Upon review and discussion with management of the significant actions taken and progress achieved across each of our values\\n    and key community initiatives during 2023, the People and Compensation Committee modified the preliminary payout opportunities by\\n    7.5% and awarded Cash Incentive Plan payouts equal to 178.6% of the target payout opportunity for each of our named executive officers.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n63\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\nThis amount represents: (i) Apple’s contributions to Mr. Cook’s account under the 401(k)\\n    plan in the amount of $19,800; (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $2,964; (iii) vacation cash-out in\\n    the amount of $57,692; (iv) security expenses in the amount of $820,309, which represents the incremental cost to Apple for personal\\n    security services provided to Mr. Cook as determined by allocating both direct costs and a percentage of fixed costs incurred by\\n    Apple and used to provide such personal security services; (v) personal air travel expenses in the amount of $1,621,468, which represent\\n    the incremental cost to Apple for Mr. Cook’s personal use of private aircraft based on hourly flight charges and other variable\\n    costs incurred by Apple for such use, including variable fuel charges, departure fees, and landing fees; and (vi) the incremental\\n    cost to Apple for a tenure-based service award for Mr. Cook.

As a result, 100% of the time-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook in 2021 and 2022 RSUs\\n    were     considered     “vested”. A pro rata portion of Mr. Cook’s 2023 time-based RSUs are considered\\n    “vested” consistent with the     retirement provisions of that award. No other NEOs, other than Mr. Cook, have\\n    retirement provisions in their equity awards. The fair     values of the RSUs included in the compensation actually paid to\\n    our CEO and the average compensation actually paid to our other     NEOs are calculated at the required measurement\\n    dates, consistent with the approach used to value the awards at the grant date as     described above in footnote 1 to the\\n    “Summary Compensation Table     – 2023, 2022, and 2021” and footnote 1 to the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards     – 2023” table,\\n    respectively. Any changes to the time-based RSU and performance-based RSU grant date fair values (for 2023 grants)     and\\n    from prior year-end (for 2021 and 2022 grants) are based on an updated stock price valuation on the measurement dates and\\n    for     the performance-based RSUs, including updated input variables for the Monte-Carlo model to estimate the probability\\n    of satisfying     the performance objectives established for the respective award.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n71\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\nThe dollar amounts in column (d) represent the average amounts of compensation reported for the other\\n    NEOs for each corresponding year in the “Total” column of the “Summary Compensation Table     – 2023, 2022, and 2021” as set forth on page 62 of this\\n    proxy statement.\\xa0For each of 2021, 2022 and 2023, the other NEOs were Luca Maestri, Kate Adams, Deirdre O’Brien, and\\n    Jeff Williams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(4)\\nApple’s TSR in column (f) was determined based on the value of an initial fixed investment\\n    of $100, as of September 26, 2020, including the reinvestment of any dividends.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(5)\\nThe peer groups used to calculate Peer Group TSR in column (g) are our primary peer group as disclosed\\n    in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, our 2023 Proxy Statement for 2022 and our 2022 Proxy\\n    Statement for 2021. TSR is based on the value of an initial fixed investment of $100 at the start of 2021 and is weighted for the\\n    market capitalization of each peer company in each applicable year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(6)\\nIn addition to Relative TSR and Operating Income, Net Sales in column (i) represents the most important\\n    financial performance measure used to link Compensation Actually Paid to company performance (the “Company Selected Measure”\\n    as defined in the Pay Versus Performance rules). \\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRelationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and our Total Shareholder\\nReturn\\n\\xa0\\nLong-term equity incentives represent a vast majority\\nof our NEOs’ total target compensation and our stock price performance or TSR is the key driver of Compensation Actually Paid. We also\\nuse Relative TSR as the key performance measure for our performance-based RSUs. \\xa0Over the three-year period covered in this disclosure,\\nApple’s TSR on an absolute basis was high, 55.24%, and outperformed the TSR of our primary peer group by 16.88%. \\xa0Apple’s\\nRelative TSR measured against the members of the S&P 500 Index (the peer group for performance-based RSUs) was also strong, resulting\\nin above-target payouts for the performance-based RSUs with applicable performance periods ending in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Further, the\\nTSR relative to the currently outstanding performance-based RSUs (granted in 2022 and 2023) continues to trend towards above-target payouts\\ndue to strong TSR relative to the members of the S&P 500. \\xa0This shows how Compensation Actually Paid to our NEOs and TSR are\\ntightly\\xa0linked.\\n\\xa0\\nThe 2021 Compensation Actually Paid values\\nfor the CEO and NEOs are higher than the Summary Compensation Table totals in 2021, and higher than the Compensation Actually\\nPaid values in 2022 and 2023 because Apple’s significant and outstanding stock price increase in the years immediately\\npreceding 2021 resulted in our NEOs holding a larger value of unvested equity awards as of the start of 2021. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nRelationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Income\\n\\xa0\\nNet Income is generally a key indicator of company profitability\\nand for Apple can contribute to changes in our stock price, which in turn drives Compensation Actually Paid. \\xa0We do not use Net Income\\nas a financial measure in our executive compensation program but Operating Income from which Net Income is derived. Operating Income and\\nNet Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan.\\n\\xa0\\nRelationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales\\n\\xa0\\nNet Sales is one of the two financial measures, the\\nPeople and Compensation Committee has set for our Cash Incentive Plan, and therefore along with Operating Income is the next most important\\nfinancial metric in determining Compensation Actually Paid behind Relative TSR. Strong performance in Net Sales and Operating Income led\\nto above target bonus payouts in 2021, 2022, and 2023 which in turn increased Compensation Actually Paid.\\n\\xa0\\nTabular List of Apple’s most important metrics that link Compensation\\nActually Paid to the Mr. Cook and other NEOs\\n\\xa0\\nFor 2023, the following list represented the most important\\nfinancial performance measures used by Apple to link Compensation Actually Paid with our financial performance:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNet Sales\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOperating Income\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRelative TSR\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n72\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCEO Pay Ratio—2023\\n\\xa0\\nWe offer a wide range of benefits to our global employee\\npopulation, and we are committed to paying our employees competitively and equitably based on their role.\\n\\xa0\\nFor 2023, we used the same median employee that was\\nidentified in 2022 since there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation that we reasonably believe would\\nresult in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure.\\n\\xa0\\nWe determined our median compensated employee in 2022\\nby using base salary, bonuses, commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2022 as our consistently\\napplied compensation measure. We applied this measure to our global employee population as of September 24, 2022, the last day of our\\n2022 fiscal year, and annualized base salaries for permanent full-time and part-time employees that did not work the full year.\\n\\xa0\\nWe calculated the median compensated\\nemployee’s 2023 annual total compensation using the same methodology that is used to calculate our CEO’s annual\\ntotal compensation in the table entitled “Summary Compensation Table–2023, 2022, and 2021.” The 2023 annual\\ntotal compensation of our CEO was $63,209,845, the 2023 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was\\n$94,118, and the ratio of these amounts is 672 to 1. Thus, this pay ratio reflects a reasonable estimate consistent with SEC\\nrules based on the methodology we described above. Because SEC rules for identifying a median compensated employee allow\\ncompanies to apply certain exclusions, include estimates, and adopt different methodologies that reflect their employee\\npopulation and compensation practices, the ratio above may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other\\ncompanies.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n73\\n\\n\\nManagementProposals\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nProposal\\n    No. 1 - Election of Directors\\n\\xa0\\n74\\n\\xa0\\n\\nProposal\\n    No. 2 - Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\n\\xa0\\n75\\n\\xa0\\n\\nProposal\\n    No. 3 - Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation\\n\\xa0\\n77\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n74\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProposal No. 1\\nElection of Directors\\n\\xa0\\nThe Board has nominated Wanda Austin, Tim Cook, Alex Gorsky, Andrea\\nJung, Art Levinson, Monica Lozano, Ron Sugar, and Sue Wagner to be elected to serve on our Board until the next annual meeting\\nof shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.\\n\\xa0\\nHolders of proxies solicited by this Proxy Statement will vote the\\nproxies received by them as directed on the proxy card or, if no direction is made, for the election of the Board’s eight\\nnominees.\\n\\xa0\\nThe term of any incumbent director who does not receive the affirmative\\nvote of (i)\\xa0a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)\\xa0a majority\\nof the shares required to constitute a quorum, and has not earlier resigned, will end on the date that is the earlier of (a) 90\\xa0days\\nafter the date on which the voting results for the Annual Meeting are determined by the inspector of election, or (b) the date\\non which the Board selects a person to fill the office held by that director in accordance with Apple’s bylaws.\\n\\xa0\\nEach of the director nominees has consented to serving as a nominee,\\nbeing named in this Proxy Statement, and serving on the Board if elected.

(“Apple”) issue\\na public report detailing the potential risks associated with omitting “viewpoint” and “ideology” from\\nits written equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy. The report should be available within a reasonable timeframe, prepared at\\na reasonable expense and omit proprietary information.\\n\\xa0\\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT\\n\\xa0\\nApple does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on viewpoint\\nor ideology in its written EEO policy.\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s lack of a company-wide best practice EEO policy\\nsends mixed signals to company employees and prospective employees and calls into question the extent to which individuals are\\nprotected due to inconsistent state policies and the absence of federal protection for partisan activities. Approximately half\\nof Americans live and work in a jurisdiction with no legal protections if their employer takes action against them for their political\\nactivities. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCompanies with inclusive policies are better able to recruit\\nthe most talented employees from a broad labor pool, resolve complaints internally to avoid costly litigation or reputational damage,\\nand minimize employee turnover. Moreover, inclusive policies contribute to more efficient human capital management by eliminating\\nthe need to maintain different policies in different locations.\\n\\xa0\\nThere is ample evidence that individuals with conservative viewpoints\\nmay face discrimination at Apple.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nIn general, Silicon Valley is hostile to\\nright-of-center thought. At the 2019 annual meeting of Apple shareholders, an audience member told company CEO Tim Cook about\\nher close friend who works at Apple and lives in fear of retribution every single day because she happens to be a conservative.\\nWhat she described was the textbook definition of a hostile work environment. Apple has also refused requests to increase the\\nviewpoint diversity of its board.(1) This also signals to employees that viewpoint\\ndiscrimination is condoned if not encouraged.\\n\\xa0\\nPresently shareholders are unable to evaluate how Apple prevents\\ndiscrimination towards employees based on their ideology or viewpoint, mitigates employee concerns of potential discrimination,\\nand ensures a respectful and supportive work atmosphere that bolsters employee performance.\\n\\xa0\\nWithout an inclusive EEO policy, Apple may be sacrificing competitive\\nadvantages relative to peers while simultaneously increasing company and shareholder exposure to reputational and financial risks.\\n\\xa0\\nWe recommend that the report evaluate risks including, but not\\nlimited to, negative effects on employee hiring and retention, as well as litigation risks from conflicting state and company anti-discrimination\\npolicies.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\nhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2019/02/21/shareholders-to-vote-on-requiring-apple-to-disclose-board-nominees-ideology/\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n84\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.\\xa04\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAGAINST\\nProposal No. 4\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe\\xa0Board\\xa0recommends\\xa0a\\xa0vote\\xa0AGAINST\\xa0Proposal\\xa0No.\\xa04\\xa0because:\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nwe are committed to nurturing a culture where every great idea can\\n        be heard and where everyone belongs, including those with differing viewpoints and ideologies;\\n●\\n our policies, practices, and trainings already address the proposal’s\\n        concern, and a report on potential risks to the Company of omitting “viewpoint” and “ideology” from our EEO\\n        policy would not provide material additional information to shareholders; and\\n●\\nour Board maintains active oversight of our Apple values, including\\n        inclusion and diversity, and of matters relating to Apple’s people and teams.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAt Apple, we are committed to treating everyone with dignity\\nand respect and believe that both Apple and its shareholders benefit from nurturing a culture where everyone belongs.\\n\\xa0\\nWe are committed to nurturing\\na culture where every great idea can be heard and where everyone belongs, including those with differing viewpoints\\nand ideologies. Inclusion and diversity is one of Apple’s values, which means we want every employee to feel a\\nsense of belonging in the workplace, where their perspectives are respected, sought out, and considered fairly. We believe\\nthat when we create a workplace where everyone feels comfortable sharing their diverse experiences and perspectives, we\\nremove the barriers that prevent people from being fully engaged and, in turn, facilitate creativity and productivity.\\n\\xa0\\nA culture of open dialogue and supportive feedback\\nalso requires respect, including for those with different points of view. That is why respect is a foundational element of our\\nculture. It is necessary for great collaboration. It is necessary for great debate. It is necessary for our ideas, products, and\\nservices to be as great as they can be. We believe every employee has a role in making our workplace respectful and welcoming for\\neveryone, which is why we require every Apple employee to participate in trainings on respect and inclusion.\\n\\xa0\\nOur policies already address the\\nproposal’s concern and therefore a report would not provide additional material information. Because our commitment\\nto a respectful and inclusive workplace is broadly scoped and embedded across our policies, practices, and trainings, we\\nbelieve the risk to Apple of omitting viewpoint or ideology specifically from our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy (EEO\\nPolicy) is low, and a report on potential risks would not provide material additional information to shareholders.\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s EEO Policy states that, “Apple is an equal\\nopportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting” on many specifically enumerated\\ncategories, including any “basis protected by law.” This latter protection would include any state or local law that\\nprovides employees protection with respect to political activities or political affiliation, such as laws in locations like California,\\nNew York State, and Washington D.C. While the proponent’s concerns are already addressed under applicable law, which flows\\nthrough to our EEO Policy, our commitment to inclusion and respect is broader and permeates all our policies and practices.\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Business Conduct and\\nCompliance policies are foundational to how we do business and how we put our values into practice every day. In setting this\\nfoundation, our Business Conduct Policy states, “Apple is dedicated to maintaining a creative, diverse, inclusive, and\\nsupportive work environment, and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of employees or non-employees with whom we\\nhave a business, service, or professional relationship,” thus anchoring our goal of fostering acceptance and supporting\\ndiversity in all of its aspects, including diversity based on differing viewpoints and ideologies, in one of our main guiding\\npolicies. All employees are required to complete training on the Business Conduct Policy upon hiring and annually thereafter.\\nAnd the training makes clear that maintaining a culture where our differences are celebrated is a responsibility shared by\\neveryone at Apple.\\n\\xa0\\nWe want to make sure we’re doing everything we can to safeguard\\nand reinforce a culture free from harassment and discrimination and to ensure employees feel fully empowered to report inappropriate\\nor discriminatory conduct, without fear of retaliation. That is why we also offer a range of resources for employees to address\\nquestions and report concerns, including People Support, the Business Conduct Helpline, and the Business Conduct website, as well\\nas an external reporting hotline. All matters are carefully and thoroughly reviewed, and our policy strictly prohibits any retaliation\\nfor reporting potential employee misconduct or participating in an investigation.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n85\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe also regularly engage our employees in surveys to learn about\\nwhat’s going well and how we can do better in areas like career development, manager performance, and inclusivity, and teams\\nare encouraged to create action plans based on survey results. Notably, in our 2023 employee surveys, results indicate that employees\\nfeel accepted at Apple, and that they can comfortably share ideas and opinions that are different from their team’s.\\n\\xa0\\nOur Board maintains active oversight. Our People and Compensation\\nCommittee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s strategies, policies, and practices relating to Apple’s\\npeople and teams, including with respect to inclusion and diversity, culture and employee engagement, talent recruitment, development,\\nand retention, and our Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of matters relating to business conduct and legal and\\nregulatory compliance.

(“Apple”\\nor “the Company”) uses to curate app content on its various platforms, and procedures by which the Company manages\\ndisputes between government interests and user rights.\\n\\xa0\\nSupporting\\xa0Statement:\\n\\xa0\\nGiven their facilitatory role in securing access to online services,\\nthe actions of major tech companies can significantly affect the businesses using their platforms and ignite concerns over limiting\\naccess to that content. Given their role in the online age, tech companies have a responsibility to use their influence to protect\\nsuch inherent human rights as “freedom of thought, conscience, and religion,” particularly for underprivileged and\\nmarginalized populations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAs shareholders of Apple Inc., we believe Apple is uniquely situated\\nto help protect these rights and ought to commit to maintaining access to app services as a necessary consequence of its commitment\\nto human rights. We are therefore greatly concerned at recent reports of Apple arbitrarily limiting content access within its online\\nservices, as detailed below. This censorship endangers Apple’s trust with its users and jeopardizes Apple’s stated\\ncommitments to human rights and providing quality products. Shareholders must know that Apple will meaningfully commit to protecting\\nreliable app access as a crucial aspect of both good social policy and respecting its users’ civil liberties.\\n\\xa0\\nApple has defended the connection between human\\nrights and technological access in its Commitment to Human Rights (1), further asserting its primary emphasis on maintaining\\nusers’ “access to reliable information and helpful technology.” Yet, recent actions call the veracity of such\\ncommitments into question.\\n\\xa0\\nApple has been characterized by the 1792\\nExchange as “leverag[ing] its corporate reputation and funds to support... groups hostile to freedom of\\nexpression,” most recently the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Reporting indicates Apple’s removal of popular\\nQuran (2) (Quran Majeed) and Bible (3) (Olive Tree) reading apps from its App Store in China, at the\\nrequest of authorities within the CCP. Furthermore, as detailed in the 2022 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity Index (4),\\nApple does not provide a clear standard as to what apps are and not allowed on its platforms, indicating a concerning absence\\nof protocol to determine what content is permissible (5), further amplified by recent concerns over Apple’s\\nthreat to remove Twitter (X) from its App Store (6), a seemingly political swipe that conservative lawmakers have\\ncharacterized as a “raw exercise of monopolistic power.”\\xa0(7)\\xa0These actions conflict with\\nApple’s stated Commitment to Human Rights and the interest of millions of Apple’s users in reliably accessing\\ncontent. Furthermore, the perception that Apple does not respect the civil liberties of its users and vendors\\ncreates significant reputational risk and risk of political backlash, threatening shareholder value.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\nhttps://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/2020/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf\\n\\n(2)\\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230\\n\\n(3)\\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/apple-takes-down-quran-bible-jehovahs-witenss-apps-in-china-2021-10\\n\\n(4)\\nhttps://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/business-index\\n\\n(5)\\nhttps://1792exchange.com/pdf/?c_id=667\\n\\n(6)\\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-apple-app-store/index.html\\n\\n(7)\\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2022/11/29/\\n desantis-attacks-apple-for-allegedly-threatening-to-remove-musk-run-twitter-from-app-store-joining-other-republicans/?sh=52d24b8950d1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n87\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.\\xa05\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAGAINST\\nProposal No. 5\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0Board\\xa0recommends\\xa0a\\xa0vote\\xa0AGAINST\\xa0Proposal\\xa0No.\\xa05\\xa0because:\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nApple is committed to respecting\\n        human rights, including civil rights, freedom of expression, and access to information, and we review our procedures for\\n        administering the App Store for alignment with this commitment; and\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nwe already provide the requested\\n        information about the standards and procedures Apple uses to curate apps available in the App Store and about government\\n        orders to take down apps, all under the active oversight of our Board.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSince it launched in 2008, the App Store has proven to be a safe and\\ntrusted place to discover and download apps.

Across our products and services, we strive to reflect our respect for human rights, including\\nprivacy, freedom of expression, and non-discrimination, which is grounded in our Human Rights Policy.\\xa0(1)\\xa0We\\nreview our app review process for alignment with best practices and our human rights commitments. And we engage with external\\nstakeholders that include United Nations bodies, nongovernmental organizations, investors, and human rights experts to seek feedback\\non issues such as freedom of expression and access to information. We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times\\nthere are complex considerations and issues where we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the most appropriate\\npath or outcome. In these instances, we prioritize engagement, advocating for the outcome we believe is in the best interests\\nof our users — their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their ability to access reliable information and\\nhelpful technology.\\n\\xa0\\nWe already publicly provide the\\nrequested criteria that guide our App Store curation. The guiding principle of the App Store is simple — we want to\\nprovide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by\\noffering a highly curated App Store where apps are reviewed by specialists, and an editorial team helps users discover new\\napps every day. And we disclose the standards and procedures that we apply in reviewing apps in our publicly available App\\nStore Review Guidelines.\\xa0(2)\\n\\xa0\\nTo fulfill our goals for the App Store, trained experts from our App Review team\\nreview every app and app update for compliance with the App Review Guidelines, a process outlined in our Digital Services Act\\nTransparency Report.\\xa0(3)\\xa0The App Store review process is carried out by hundreds of human App Review\\nspecialists, representing 81 languages across three time zones. All App Review specialists charged with continuing review of\\napps published on the App Store receive comprehensive training when they join the App Review team. This training is\\nsupplemented by ongoing training so that specialists remain informed of new and emerging threats and issues. App Review\\nspecialists also receive language- and region-specific training that covers cultural and sensitivity issues as they relate to\\nenforcing the App Store Review Guidelines. Difficult decisions are escalated to Apple’s Executive Review Board,\\ncomposed of senior leaders who have ultimate decision-making responsibility regarding the App Store, including app takedowns,\\nfurther engagement, or an exploration of viable alternatives, as appropriate.\\n\\xa0\\nAs part of the review process, Apple works hard to prevent illegal\\ncontent from ending up on a country’s storefront. Apple seeks to abide by the laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as\\nall companies operating in such jurisdictions must do. Whenever possible, apps that are removed from the App Store will only be\\nremoved in countries and territories specific to the issue, and will remain available in locations that aren’t impacted.\\nIf a developer believes their app should be reinstated on the App Store, they can appeal the removal.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\ninvestor.apple.com/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy\\n\\n(2)\\ndeveloper.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\\n\\n(3)\\napple.com/legal/dsa/transparency/eu/app-store/2310/\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n88\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe already provide the\\nrequested reporting about government orders to take down apps. Apple reports transparently and comprehensively on our\\nefforts to help keep the App Store a safe and trusted place for users to find the apps they love. For calendar year 2022, we\\nexpanded our prior biannual transparency reporting, which was focused on app removal requests by law enforcement and\\nregulatory agencies, to offer a comprehensive App Store Transparency Report.\\xa0(4)\\n\\xa0\\nIn the App Store Transparency Report, we\\ndisclose:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nthe number of all apps removed, broken out by app category (e.g. games, utilities, business,\\n    education, etc.), with further break-out by country and region;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nthe number of all apps removed for policy violations, broken out by App Store Review Guideline\\n    or Developer Program License Agreement provision violated, with further break-out by country and region;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nthe number of all apps removed pursuant to government requests to remove illegal content,\\n    broken out by government entity and law cited;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nthe number of appeals of app removals, broken out by country and region; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nthe number of app restorations after appeals, broken out by country and region.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe App Store Transparency Report helps give developers and the public\\na comprehensive and transparent view of how our guidelines work in practice, including with respect to government takedowns.\\n\\xa0\\nWe provide notice to developers of removed\\napps. In addition to the information in the App Store Transparency Report, we provide notice directly to the affected developer\\nwhen an app is removed from the App Store, and the developer can appeal the removal if they believe the removal was made in error.\\nIn the case of a government request to remove an app from the App Store, Apple has established a procedure so that the notice\\nto the developer includes details regarding the legal authority making the request and the legal basis that the authority cites\\nfor doing so. This notice and appeal procedure is publicly disclosed on our website for developers.\\xa0(5)\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe our approach of providing notice directly to developers\\nbest meets their interests and expectations as it leaves the avenues of redress in their hands without publishing potentially sensitive\\ninformation. A developer can, however, always elect to make the details of the government request more widely available if they\\nchoose to do so.\\n\\xa0\\nOur Board maintains active oversight. Apple’s Board is\\nresponsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing Apple’s Human Rights Policy, while Apple’s General Counsel is\\nresponsible for its ongoing implementation and reports to the Board and its committees on progress and any significant issues identified\\nin the diligence process. The Board is also regularly updated on the App Store business, including legal and regulatory matters.\\nOur Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring our significant business risks, including operational and reputational exposures\\nthat may relate to compliance with governmental laws, regulations, and orders, or to human rights issues.

These metrics are assessed by a third-party firm that evaluates compensation across\\nall of Apple using statistical modeling. We continuously review and seek to improve the accuracy of this analysis and also review gaps\\nwithin each line of business to determine whether there are any clusters in particular areas of the business that require further analysis.\\n\\xa0\\nTo further promote pay equity, it is our policy\\nnot to ask employee candidates for compensation history, and our recruiters develop offers of employment based on location of hire, job\\nlevel, and job title. In addition, during our annual compensation planning process, our People team uses analytics to assess promotion\\nrates, performance ratings distribution, and pay metrics for women compared to men and, in the United States, for underrepresented groups\\ncompared to non-underrepresented groups. We also seek to pay competitive wages across our global operations, and all employees are eligible\\nto become shareholders in the Company through our discretionary stock programs.\\n\\xa0\\nThe results of our efforts to achieve\\npay equity are tangible. Since 2017, we have achieved gender pay equity globally, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity\\nin the United States. Since 2022, we have also achieved pay equity at the intersections of gender and race and ethnicity in\\nour U.S. workforce.\\xa0In July 2023, we published of a third-party Civil Rights Assessment report prepared by former\\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his team at Covington\\xa0& Burling LLP, which describes the significant resources\\nApple has invested to rigorously track and manage pay equity across Apple.\\n\\xa0\\nConsistent with our goal of promoting equal employment\\nopportunity, we also continue to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the Company to help Apple identify the best\\ntalent in the world, and become an even better reflection of the world we live in. We do that by taking a comprehensive approach, from\\nexpanding our diversity outreach efforts, including our ties with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving\\nInstitutions (HSIs), and other organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented communities, and having more diverse interview\\npanels and candidates so that diversity is reflected at every stage of the hiring process, to fostering an inclusive culture and empowering\\ncommunities.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n91\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTaking into consideration the comprehensive approach\\nwe have and continue to promote with respect to pay equity, and given the diverse roles in our workforce and global operations, we do\\nnot believe a single median pay figure is a meaningful metric for Apple. This statistic seeks to compare the median of two employees whose\\ncompensation happens to fall at the midpoint of a pay distribution and does not account for valid factors that affect pay, such as role,\\nskills, qualifications, location, country, performance, and experience. Our shareholders would not benefit from a substitute measure for\\nour progress toward a more inclusive workforce, particularly one that does not lend itself to company-to-company comparison due to the\\nhighly divergent composition of workforces based on industry and location.\\n\\xa0\\nApple fosters an inclusive culture to promote\\ndiverse representation. At Apple, we believe building an inclusive culture rooted in community helps everyone, in every part of Apple,\\nfeel supported, valued, connected, and empowered to do the best work of their lives. From day one, Apple employees have access to our\\ncareer development programs, ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support throughout their career journeys. For example, our\\nglobal Career Experiences program enables hands-on development opportunities for Apple Store, service, and support team members by creating\\nmonths-long rotations in technical, operations, and corporate functions across Apple. Participants can build new skills, explore an aspirational\\nrole up close, and gain in-role experience, while host teams benefit from the unique customer-facing perspectives, talents, and passions\\nof participants.\\n\\xa0\\nFurther, all our employees are required to complete\\ninclusion training, which reiterates our policies against harassment and discrimination. In addition, all our managers are required to\\ntake inclusive leadership training, which emphasizes their responsibility in creating and fostering a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for all of their employees.\\n\\xa0\\nFor more than 35 years, Apple employees have found\\ncommunity and connection in our Diversity Network Associations (DNAs). These employee-led groups foster a culture of belonging through\\neducation, leadership, development, networking, and volunteering, while also encouraging the kind of open dialogue that leads to stronger\\nallyship across Apple. Today, over 60,000 Apple employees across the globe belong to groups like Accessibility@Apple, AsianPacific@Apple,\\nBeacon@Apple, Black@Apple, Familia@Apple, Indigenous@Apple, Pride@Apple, SouthAsian@Apple, Women@Apple, and more.\\n\\xa0\\nApple empowers communities. Our work to increase\\nrepresentation doesn’t stop at our own doors, and we believe our work supporting and empowering our communities will also help increase\\ndiverse representation in our workforce. We are committed to supporting and empowering communities around the world, and to date have\\ncommitted more than $200 million to Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI). This funding supports projects and partnerships\\nacross three priority areas: education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform.\\n\\xa0\\nApple also supports two distinct learning and innovation\\nhubs — the Propel Center and the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub — focused on building a diverse ecosystem of leaders. With\\nmore than 75 percent of HBCUs now engaged with Propel, the opportunity to reach and serve thousands of HBCU faculty and students at scale\\nis significant. And with more than 500 HSIs now reaching over 2.2\\xa0million undergraduate students across the United States, the Global\\nHSI Equity Innovation Hub will collaborate with other California State University campuses and HSIs throughout the country to accelerate\\neducational equity while providing skills to support post-graduation success.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd in collaboration with Michigan\\nState University, we launched our Apple Developer Academy in Detroit — our first in the United States — to\\nprepare students from all backgrounds for jobs in the iOS app economy. And in 2022, we established a partnership with\\nLondon’s Southbank Centre, which represents Apple’s first REJI expansion in Europe. In addition to the\\nfundamentals of coding, academy participants learn skills like design, marketing, and project management, with an emphasis on\\ninclusivity and making a positive impact in their communities.\\n\\xa0\\nWe already provide robust transparent reporting\\nand are working to further expand it in response to new regulations globally. Consistent with our goal of promoting equal employment\\nopportunity, we continue to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the Company to help Apple identify the best talent\\nin the world, and become an even better reflection of the world we live in. We are proud of the progress we have made, and share our progress\\non our Inclusion and Diversity website, which provides data on the ratio of women and people from underrepresented communities in our\\nworkforce, as well as within tech, nontech, leadership, retail, and retail leadership roles. We also share on our website statistics regarding\\nhiring for leadership positions. And we have been making our Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 publicly available since 2015 in\\nthe spirit of further transparency.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n92\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, numerous jurisdictions globally are at different stages\\nof adoption and implementation of legislation requiring the disclosure of pay gap metrics across a company’s workforce.

This report shall be made publicly\\navailable to the company’s shareholders on the company’s website, be prepared at a reasonable cost, and omit any information\\nthat is proprietary, privileged, or violative of contractual obligations.\\n\\xa0\\nSupporting Statement\\n\\xa0\\nIf adopted, this proposal asks our company to issue\\na transparency report on the company’s use of AI technology and to disclose any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted\\nregarding AI technology. We believe that adopting an ethical framework for the use of AI technology will strengthen our company’s\\nposition as a responsible and sustainable leader in its industry. By addressing the ethical considerations of AI in a transparent manner,\\nwe can build trust among our company’s stakeholders and contribute positively to society.\\n\\xa0\\nThe adoption of AI technology into\\nbusiness raises a number of significant social policy issues. For example, the use of AI in human resources decisions may\\nraise concerns about discrimination or bias against employees. The use of AI to automate jobs may result in mass layoffs and\\nthe closing of entire facilities. AI may be used in ways that violate the privacy of customers and members of the public. AI\\ntechnology may be used to generate “deep fake” media content that may result in the dissemination of false\\ninformation in political elections.\\n\\xa0\\nThe White House Office of Science\\nand Technology Policy has developed a set of ethical guidelines to help guide the design, use, and deployment of AI. These\\nfive principles for an AI Bill of Rights are 1) safe and effective systems, 2) algorithmic discrimination protections, 3)\\ndata privacy, 4) notice and explanation, and 5) human alternatives, consideration, and fallback. (White House Office of\\nScience and Technology Policy, “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American\\nPeople,” October 2022, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights).\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe that the adoption of ethical\\nguidelines for the use of AI can help improve our company’s bottom line by avoiding costly labor disruptions. In 2023,\\nwriters and performers went on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers in part over concerns\\nthat the use of AI technology to create media content will infringe on the intellectual property and publicity rights of\\nwriters and performers and potentially displace human creators. (Wall Street Journal, “Hollywood’s Fight: How\\nMuch AI Is Too Much?,” July 31, 2023, available at https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-the-core-of-hollywoods-ai-fight-how-far-is-too-far-f57630df).\\n\\xa0\\nIn our view, AI systems should not be trained on\\ncopyrighted works, or the voices, likenesses and performances of professional performers, without transparency, consent and compensation\\nto creators and rights holders. We also believe that AI should not be used to create literary material, to replace or supplant the creative\\nwork of professional writers.\\n\\xa0\\nFor these reasons, we urge you to vote FOR this\\nshareholder proposal.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n94\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.\\xa07\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAGAINST\\nProposal No. 7\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe\\xa0Board\\xa0recommends\\xa0a\\xa0vote\\xa0AGAINST\\xa0Proposal\\xa0No.\\xa07\\xa0because:\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nwe are committed to responsibly advancing our products and services\\n    that use artificial intelligence and already provide resources and transparency on our approach to artificial intelligence and machine\\n    learning, all under the active oversight of our Board; and\\n\\xa0\\n●\\nthe scope of the requested report is extremely broad and could\\n    encompass disclosure of strategic plans and initiatives harmful to our competitive position and would be premature in this developing\\n    area.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAt Apple, we believe the measure of any great innovation\\nis the positive impact it has on people’s lives. It’s why we work every day to make our technology an even greater force for\\ngood. Today, our teams around the world work to infuse Apple’s deeply held values into everything we make. That work can take many\\nforms. But whether we’re protecting the right to privacy, designing technology that is accessible to all, or using more recycled\\nmaterials in our products than ever, we are always working to make a difference for the people we serve and the planet we inhabit.\\n\\xa0\\nApple has a robust approach to addressing ethical\\nconsiderations across our business operations and that addresses the issues raised in the proposal. We believe it’s important\\nto be deliberate and thoughtful in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence, and that companies think through the consequences\\nof new technology before releasing it — something we’ve always been deeply committed to at Apple. Social issues raised in\\nthe proposal, like discrimination, bias, and privacy may be implicated by AI technologies, but are not unique to the application of AI.\\nAccordingly, our existing guidelines, policies, and procedures already address the social issues raised, as described below.\\n\\xa0\\nOur approach to human rights: In all of\\nour work, Apple’s values are a driving force. We’re deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights\\nin our business operations,\\xa0(1)\\xa0and align our efforts with the business and human rights due diligence process set\\nforth in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As part of our processes, we conduct due diligence to identify\\nrisks and work to mitigate them. This includes identification of salient human rights risks across our organization through internal\\nrisk assessments and external industry-level third-party audits, as well as through communication channels maintained with rights holders\\nand other stakeholders.\\n\\xa0\\nIn 2023, we published a Civil Rights Assessment\\nreport prepared by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his team at Covington\\xa0& Burling LLP. The report reviews\\nApple’s extensive efforts to respect civil rights and promote equity, diversity, and inclusion, and live by its core values, including\\naccessibility, inclusion and diversity, and privacy. These efforts, many of which began years ago, are reflected in Apple’s current\\npolicies and practices, which are detailed in Covington’s report.\\n\\xa0\\nOur approach to transparency: Apple’s\\nworld-class machine learning and AI research team, led by our Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, collaborates\\nwith teams across Apple to drive breakthrough advancements in machine learning, and we have a dedicated Apple Machine Learning Research\\nwebsite\\xa0(2)\\xa0where we provide meaningful visibility into our machine learning research and aim to make our products\\nand services incorporating machine learning easy to understand. We also publish Human Interface Guidelines,\\xa0(3)\\xa0including\\ndedicated sections on Inclusion, Accessibility, Privacy, and Machine Learning, among others, to support developers in their work to build\\ninclusive apps that put people first by prioritizing respectful communication and presenting content and functionality in ways that everyone\\ncan access and understand. Further, we provide tools, documentation, sample code, and design best practices to help developers make their\\napps more accessible.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\ninvestor.apple.com/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy \\n\\n(2)\\nmachinelearning.apple.com \\n\\n(3)\\ndeveloper.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n95\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition to our machine learning research website\\nand our Human Interface Guidelines, Apple also reports extensively on our commitment to inclusion and diversity\\xa0(4)\\xa0and\\nprivacy\\xa0(5)\\xa0throughout our business. We believe these disclosures provide a robust level of transparency to assure\\nstakeholders of our commitment to values-driven development while balancing the need to protect the proprietary information that is foundational\\nto our business.\\n\\xa0\\nOur approach to inclusive design: We strive\\nto build products and services aligned with our values and human rights commitments, as noted in the Civil Rights Assessment report. To\\ncite just a few examples, Apple is engaged in an ongoing process to make Siri a more inclusive and accessible feature, including by engaging\\nsocio-linguist experts to improve speech recognition accuracy rates for users of different ethnic/racial, gender, and geographic backgrounds\\nand working in partnership with Black and African American Vernacular English-speaking volunteers. Additionally, in developing Face ID,\\nApple appreciated from the outset that facial recognition algorithms had been associated with divergent error rates across demographic\\ngroups and so worked with volunteer participants from around the world to include a representative group of people accounting for gender,\\nage, ethnicity, disability, and other factors. And we’re taking steps to advance equity in our cameras’ person recognition\\nfeatures. As a result, the machine learning models used in camera technology aim to show similar performance across various age groups,\\ngenders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other attributes.\\n\\xa0\\nOur approach to privacy: We also\\nbelieve that privacy is a fundamental human right, and we’re constantly innovating to give users more transparency and control\\nover their data. We regularly engage with civil society representatives globally on various privacy and freedom of expression\\nissues, including privacy by design and encryption, and our Privacy Policy\\xa0(6)\\xa0and service-specific privacy\\nnotices\\xa0(7)\\xa0reflect our belief that privacy must remain a top priority in all that we do. Our management\\nPrivacy Steering Committee sets privacy standards for teams across Apple and acts as an escalation point for addressing privacy\\ncompliance issues. The committee is chaired by Apple’s General Counsel and its members include Apple’s Senior Vice\\nPresidents of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, Software, and Services, and a cross-functional group of senior representatives\\nfrom across the business.\\n\\xa0\\nThe scope of the requested report is overly broad\\nand could encompass disclosure of strategic plans and initiatives harmful to our competitive position. This proposal addresses our\\nuse of artificial intelligence across our “business operations.” The proposal does not focus on any specific novel use of\\nAI at Apple and, in fact, references well-established applications of software such as automation of systems. Broadly defined, the requested\\nreport could encompass every aspect of our business, including whether and how we use automated systems in, for example, product development\\nand research, supply chain management, financial management and planning, efficient management of energy use throughout our physical plant\\nand buildings, monitoring of cyber and physical security at our facilities, coordinating employee benefit or other personnel programs,\\nand conducting a wide range of other aspects of our business operations.\\n\\xa0\\nBeyond our business operations, due to\\nits broad nature, the requested report would cover virtually every product and service Apple currently offers. To cite a few\\nexamples, Siri™, which has been available for more than a decade, Personal Voice and Live Voicemail included in iOS 17,\\nand life saving features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and ECG, would simply not be possible without the use of\\nartificial intelligence and machine learning. The broad scope of the proposal therefore speaks against preparing the report\\nrequested, especially as the proponent does not point to any specific use of AI at Apple that raises concerns. Not only would\\nthe report encompass every aspect of our operations and nearly every product or service we build, it could also cover\\ncompetitively harmful disclosure of confidential research and development activities.\\n\\xa0\\nThe AI regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving.\\nApple has been and will continue to be deliberate and thoughtful in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.\\xa0However,\\nthis proposal is premature in asking for a dedicated report when the landscape is just starting to emerge and regulators around the world\\nare actively engaged in new rulemaking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(4)\\napple.com/diversity/ \\n\\n(5)\\napple.com/privacy/ \\n\\n(6)\\napple.com/legal/privacy \\n\\n(7)\\napple.com/legal/privacy/data/\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n96\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOur Board maintains active oversight.

(the “Company”)\\n“believe[s] security shouldn’t come at the expense of individual privacy.”\\xa0(1)\\xa0Its\\npublished “commitment to human rights” espouses the following principles:\\xa0(2)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\n“We believe in the power of technology to empower and connect people around the world ...”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\n“Our human rights policy governs how we treat everyone—from our customers and teams to our business partners ...”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\n“We ... make technology for people that respects their human rights, [and] empowers them with useful tools and information ...”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\n“We believe in the critical importance of an open society in which information flows freely, and we’re convinced the best way we can continue to promote openness is to remain engaged, even where we may disagree with a country’s laws ...”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n●\\n“We work every day to make quality products ... available to our users in a way that respects their human rights. We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments ...”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhile any freedom-loving individual would likely admire such principles,\\nApple appears to implement — or rescind — them inconsistently across countries where it conducts business, and incongruently\\nwith its principles.\\n\\xa0\\nFor example in China, the Company severely restricted use of its AirDrop\\nwireless filesharing feature on users’ iPhones during protests against Chairman Xi Jinping’s “zero COVID” policies in\\nlate 2022.\\xa0(3)\\xa0Similarly, in 2017 Apple removed the New York Times’s apps from the App Store in China in 2017,\\xa0(4)\\xa0and\\nremoved apps including HKmap.live and Quartz from its offerings, during the protests in Hong Kong in 2019.\\xa0(5)\\n\\xa0\\n Yet upon\\nthe invasion into Ukraine, the Company halted the sale of all its products in Russia and stopped exports into the country.\\xa0(6)\\xa0“We\\nare deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,”\\nsaid an Apple spokesman. As a result, Apple stood to lose as much as $1.14 billion (U.S.) annually in iPhone sales alone, and the decision\\nremoved access to Apple’s critical communications and services for victims of the war.(7)\\n\\xa0\\nConsidering these examples, it appears the Company’s principles to “empower\\nand connect people” as “a force for good” – while remaining “engaged” even where it disagrees with\\na government and its laws, by still making its products “available” to users – has its limits.\\n\\xa0\\nResolved: Shareholders request\\nthe Board of Directors issue a report by March 31,2025, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary or confidential\\ninformation, analyzing the congruency of the Company’s privacy and human rights policy positions with its actions,\\nespecially in such places as war zones and under oppressive regimes, as they impact how the Company maintains its reputation,\\nviability and profitability.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\nhttps://www.apple.com/privacy/govemment-information-requests/\\n\\n(2)\\nhttps://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/2020/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf\\n    \\n\\n(3)\\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/china-apple-airdrop-function-restricted-hnk-intl/index.html\\n    \\n\\n(4)\\nhttps://money.cnn.com/2017/01/05/technology/apple-nyt-china-app-store-remove/\\n    \\n\\n(5)\\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/media/quartz-china-apple-app-store \\n\\n(6)\\nhttps://www.npr.org/2022/03/0I/1083776364/apple-russia-pauses-sales-stops-exports\\n\\n(7)\\nhttps://www.business-standard.com/article/international/apple-to-lose-3-mn-in-iphone-sales-daily-after-russia-pull-out-122030701009_1.html\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n98\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nApple’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.\\xa08\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAGAINST\\nProposal\\xa0No.\\xa08\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe\\xa0Board\\xa0recommends\\xa0a\\xa0vote\\xa0AGAINST\\xa0Proposal\\xa0No.\\xa08\\xa0because:\\n●\\nApple is deeply committed to respecting human rights;\\n●\\nwe are transparent about our approach to complex situations and\\n    prioritizing engagement; and\\n●\\nour robust policies and disclosures are publicly available, and\\n    our Board maintains active oversight of these areas, and therefore the requested report would not provide additional material information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nApple has long been committed to respecting human\\nrights, and we view that commitment as a core part of our values and our mission to enrich people’s lives.

Each member is an independent director under Nasdaq and SEC rules,\\nand meets the standards for committee independence as set forth in Apple’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Audit and\\nFinance Committee has the duties and powers described in its written charter adopted by the Board.

In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the Audit and Finance Committee carefully\\nreviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope\\nof the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters, performance of the independent auditors, and the extent to which the independent\\nregistered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit services.\\n\\xa0\\nErnst & Young has served as Apple’s\\nindependent registered public accounting firm since 2009 and rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years. The Audit\\nCommittee is directly involved in the selection of the lead engagement partner.\\n\\xa0\\nApple maintains an auditor\\nindependence policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm from performing\\nnon-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates\\nthat the Audit and Finance Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent\\nregistered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit and Finance Committee be provided with quarterly reporting\\non actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple’s independent registered\\npublic accounting firm for non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit and Finance Committee.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed\\nand discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended September\\xa030, 2023 with Apple’s management and Ernst\\xa0&\\nYoung.

And I’m grateful\\nfor the confidence our shareholders have shown in supporting our mission.\\n\\xa0\\nOur annual shareholder meeting is an opportunity\\nto reflect on where we are today, and to look toward a future defined by innovation. We’ll hold this year’s meeting on February\\n28, 2024, and as always, I hope you’ll join us.\\n\\xa0\\nIt’s been a remarkable year. In 2023, we made\\nhistory by introducing the world to Apple’s first spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro — a revolutionary product that seamlessly\\nblends digital content with the physical world, opening a whole new dimension for our users. We also launched our powerful iPhone 15 lineup\\n— including the iPhone 15 Pro models — which continues to win over customers around the world with its profound innovations.\\n\\xa0\\nWe’re a company that’s always looking\\nforward, driven by a belief in the meaningful difference technology can make for our customers. Today — from iPad to Mac,\\nAirPods to Apple Watch — we’ve never had a stronger lineup of products. And with services like Apple TV+, the App Store, Apple\\nMusic, Apple Pay, and many more, we’ve only expanded the potential and possibility Apple can bring — from helping people find\\nconnection, entertainment and joy, to empowering them to live healthier lives.\\n\\xa0\\nWe’ve done all of this while continuing to\\nlead with our values in everything we do. That’s why we’ve put our users’ fundamental right to privacy at the center\\nof everything we do, and continued innovating to protect it. We’ve built accessibility into every product we make from the ground\\nup, because we believe the best technology should be the best technology for everyone. And we’ve continued to push forward in our\\nwork to build an even more diverse and inclusive Apple, and to carry those values beyond our doors with our Racial Equity and Justice\\nInitiative.\\n\\xa0\\nOur teams are also pressing forward to meet the\\nchallenge of climate change. Our corporate operations have run on 100% renewable energy since 2018, and with our latest Apple Watch lineup,\\nwe’ve now launched our first-ever carbon neutral models. Thanks to milestones like these, we’re closer than ever to realizing\\nApple 2030 — our goal to become carbon neutral for our supply chain and the lifetime of our products by the end of the decade.\\n\\xa0\\nAs companies and individuals, our values give us\\npurpose, our goals give us direction, and our progress gives us hope. And at Apple, we’ll continue to innovate in the belief that\\n— with hope and hard work — there is nothing we can’t achieve.\\n\\xa0\\nOn behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to thank\\nour shareholders for the confidence they’ve shown in our company, and in the bright future that lies ahead.\\n\\xa0\\nTim Cook\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Values', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.htm', 'title': '', 'language': 'No language found.'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='2023 CEO Compensation Changes\\n\\xa0\\nThe People and Compensation\\nCommittee evaluates our executive compensation program each year. The results of the Say on Pay advisory vote at the 2022 Annual\\nMeeting led to broader shareholder engagement on executive compensation. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder\\nfeedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback\\nreceived. It then approved the target annual compensation of our named executive officers for 2023, including the following changes\\nto CEO compensation, which Mr. Cook supported, and which the People and Compensation Committee believes are responsive to shareholder\\nfeedback, while continuing to align pay with performance and recognize Mr. Cook’s outstanding leadership and the exceptional\\nlong-term results he delivers to shareholders.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTarget\\n    CEO Pay\\nMr.\\n    Cook’s 2023 target total compensation was $49 million, a reduction of over 40% from his 2022 target total compensation.\\n    Taking into consideration Apple’s comparative size, scope, and success, the People and Compensation Committee also intends\\n    to position Mr. Cook’s annual target compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles relative to our primary peer\\n    group for future years.\\n\\nCEO Equity Mix\\nThe\\n    portion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook was increased from 50% to 75% of\\n    his 2023 target equity award and the portion of his performance-based RSUs will be at least 75% of his target equity awards\\n    for future years.\\n\\nCEO Retirement\\n    Vesting\\nThe\\n    time-based RSUs awarded to Mr. Cook in 2023 provide for pro-rata instead of full vesting in the event of retirement during\\n    the term of the award and only if retirement occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. The People and Compensation\\n    Committee intends to maintain this same structure for future years.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information on our executive compensation program and the 2023 compensation of our named executive officers, see the section entitled “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 46.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNominees to Apple’s Board of Directors\\n\\xa0\\nApple is overseen by directors with diverse skills,\\nqualities, attributes, and experiences that effectively address the Company’s evolving needs and represent the best interests\\nof Apple’s shareholders.

The Board also believes that the current structure allows our CEO to focus on managing Apple,\\nwhile leveraging our independent Chair’s experience to drive accountability at the Board level.\\n\\xa0\\nThe current membership and function of each\\nstanding committee is described on the following page.

The Nominating Committee considers candidates who are recommended by its members,\\nby other Board members, by shareholders, and by management, as well as those identified by third-party search firms retained to\\nassist in identifying and evaluating possible candidates. In evaluating potential nominees to the Board, the Nominating Committee\\nconsiders, among other things: independence, character, ability to exercise sound judgment, demonstrated leadership, ability and\\nwillingness to commit sufficient time to the Board, and relevant skills and experience in the context of the Board’s evolving\\nneeds. The Nominating Committee also considers the diversity of the Board overall with respect to age, disability, gender identity\\nor expression, ethnicity, military veteran status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, and other backgrounds and\\nexperiences. The Nominating Committee is committed to actively seeking out, and will instruct any search firm it engages to identify,\\nindividuals who will contribute to the overall diversity of the Board to be included in the pool of candidates from which nominees\\nto the Board are selected. 63% of nominees self-identify as women or members of an underrepresented community, and 50% of Board\\nleadership positions are held by women. The Board monitors the mix of skills and experience of its directors to help ensure it\\nhas the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively. The Nominating Committee, with the assistance of an outside\\nsearch firm, and input from our independent directors, Chair of the Board, and CEO, identified Wanda Austin as a potential candidate\\nand recommended her to the Board.\\n\\xa0\\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines require\\nan annual review by the Nominating Committee of each director’s various time commitments, including their primary occupation,\\nservice on other public company boards and board committees, leadership positions on other boards, as well as service with private\\ncompany boards and non-profit organizations. Following its review in 2023, the Nominating Committee has determined that, in its\\nview, no director currently has time commitments that would prevent them from properly discharging their duties as directors.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Nominating Committee evaluates candidates\\nrecommended by shareholders using the same criteria it applies to evaluate other candidates. Shareholders who wish to recommend\\na director candidate should submit the candidate’s name and background information in writing to our Secretary at One Apple\\nPark Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA. In addition, the proxy access provisions in our bylaws provide that a shareholder,\\nor a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares continuously for at least three years, may nominate\\ndirector nominees constituting up to 20% of Apple’s Board for inclusion in our proxy statement.

As an Apple employee, Mr. Cook, our\\nCEO, does not receive compensation for his service on the Board. The People and Compensation Committee annually reviews the total\\ncompensation of our Non-Employee Directors and each element of our Non-Employee Director compensation program. As part of this\\nprocess, the People and Compensation Committee evaluates market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance\\nLLC (“Pay Governance”), and makes a recommendation to the Board. The Board determines the form and amount of Non-Employee\\nDirector compensation after reviewing the People and Compensation Committee’s recommendation. The Apple Inc. Non-Employee\\nDirector Stock Plan (the “Director Stock Plan”) provides for an annual limit of $1.5 million for all compensation paid\\nor granted to a Non-Employee Director.\\n\\xa0\\nCash Retainers\\n\\xa0\\nOur Non-Employee Directors receive an\\nannual cash retainer of $100,000. In 2023, Pay Governance recommended to the People and Compensation Committee an annual\\nincrease of $10,000 to the cash retainer received by each of our chairs, with the first installment paid with the September\\n2023 quarterly installment. The People and Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, the increase. In 2023,\\nthe Chair of the Board, Dr. Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $175,000; the Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr.\\nSugar, received an additional cash retainer of $37,500; the Chair of the People and Compensation Committee, Ms. Jung,\\nreceived an additional cash retainer of $32,500; and the Chair of the Nominating Committee, Ms. Wagner, received an\\nadditional cash retainer of $27,500.

All Annual Director Awards\\nvest on February 1 of the following year, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date.

The number of RSUs subject to each Initial\\nDirector Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the award is pro-rated based\\non the portion of the vesting period that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards are scheduled to vest\\non the next February 1 following the grant of the award.\\n\\xa0\\nEach RSU award granted under the Director\\nStock Plan is credited with an amount equal to any ordinary dividend paid by Apple, multiplied by the total number of RSUs subject\\nto the award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for the dividend.

And following the expansion of our charter in 2023, the People and Compensation Committee\\nwill do even more to support Apple’s teams — including oversight of our investments in employee engagement, inclusion and\\ndiversity, talent recruitment, development, and retention.\\n\\xa0\\nOf course, Apple’s leadership plays a\\nkey role in fostering a culture of collaboration — driving innovation and charting a course for the future. Our\\nexecutive compensation program aims to reflect these important contributions, from leaders whose vision is so essential to\\nApple’s continued success. It also reflects feedback from our shareholders — which is an important consideration\\nevery year as we evaluate the compensation of our executive officers.\\n\\xa0\\nThat includes our Chief Executive Officer\\n— Tim Cook — whose outstanding leadership has been crucial to Apple’s success and its enduring track record\\nof innovation. Tim continues to distinguish himself as a responsible, thoughtful, and visionary leader guiding Apple. Under\\nhis leadership, the company continues to empower people with innovative technology, while staying true to the values and the\\nspirit of ingenuity that have long guided its work, and over the past three years, Apple’s total shareholder return is\\nmore than 55% — nearly 20% above the S&P 500.\\n\\xa0\\nAs a committee, we have a responsibility to\\nensure that the compensation of our CEO reflects the success of our Company and the excellence of its leadership. Last year,\\nour committee shared its intention to set Tim’s compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles of target CEO pay at\\nour primary peer companies, and 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of\\nApple’s executive compensation program. We believe positioning Tim’s compensation at this level is responsive to\\nshareholder feedback and appropriate given Apple’s relative size and scope compared to our peer companies.\\n\\xa0\\nAs we look ahead, we’re grateful\\nto our community of shareholders for their engagement, which will continue to shape the future of our executive\\ncompensation program. And together, we’ll continue to support the success of Apple’s teams, its leaders, and its\\nvital work to create technology that empowers people and enriches their lives.\\n\\xa0\\nSincerely,\\n\\xa0\\nAndrea Jung \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Al Gore \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Alex Gorsky \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Art\\nLevinson\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.htm', 'title': '', 'language': 'No language found.'}),\n",

We have a consistent and effective executive\\ncompensation program that incorporates sound policies and best practices. We also believe that the compensation of our named\\nexecutive officers should reflect the strength of our financial results and our commitment to values-driven leadership. The\\ncompensation paid to our executive officers in 2023 aligns with the continued strength of our financial results in an uneven\\nmacroeconomic environment and the significant progress made across our core values and key community initiatives. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe vast majority of our named executive officers’ compensation\\nis delivered through long-term equity awards. The performance-based equity awards that vested in 2023 reflected Apple’s exceptional\\nstock price performance for the three fiscal year period from the start of 2020 through the end of 2022. Apple’s total shareholder return\\nrelative to other companies in the S&P 500 (“Relative TSR”) was at the 98th percentile for this performance period. As\\na result, in 2023 each of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook who did not have a performance-based RSU award scheduled to\\nvest in 2023, vested in the maximum number of performance-based RSUs.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOur 2023 Named\\nExecutive Officers\\n\\xa0\\nTim Cook\\nChief Executive Officer\\n\\xa0\\nLuca Maestri\\nSenior Vice President, \\nChief Financial Officer\\n\\xa0\\nKate Adams\\nSenior Vice President, \\nGeneral Counsel and Secretary\\n\\xa0\\nDeirdre O’Brien\\nSenior Vice President, Retail\\n\\xa0\\nJeff Williams\\nChief Operating Officer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor 2023, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion\\nand operating income results of $114.3 billion. \\xa0Each of our named executive officers also received a 2023 cash incentive award\\nbased on the achievement of annual net sales and operating income performance goals and progress made in furtherance of\\nApple’s values and key community initiatives. Achievement against the net sales and operating income performance goals resulted in a payout opportunity of 166.1%.The\\nPeople and Compensation Committee also recognized the significant results delivered and progress made in 2023 in furtherance of our\\nvalues and key community initiatives and applied a 7.5% modifier to the payout opportunity for a final Cash Incentive Plan payout of\\n178.6% of target for each of our named executive officers.\\n\\xa0\\nSay on Pay Advisory Vote Results\\n\\xa0\\nFollowing the 2022 Annual Meeting, Apple\\nengaged with a significant number of our largest shareholders to discuss their perspectives with respect to our executive\\ncompensation program and CEO pay. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder feedback, Apple’s\\nexceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received and\\nmade significant changes that are reflected in the amount and structure of Mr. Cook’s 2023 compensation. 89% of votes\\ncast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation program. We\\nbelieve the 2023 Say on Pay advisory vote reflects the expanded shareholder engagement efforts, and the positive shareholder\\nresponse to the overall structure of our executive compensation program and the changes to Mr. Cook’s 2023 total target\\ncompensation.

In determining the appropriate amount of each compensation component for 2023, the People\\nand Compensation Committee considered numerous factors with the Board and its independent compensation consultant, including\\nMr. Cook’s outstanding leadership, the immense scope and complexity of his role as Apple’s CEO, the\\nBoard’s confidence in his long-term strategic decisions, the Company’s financial results delivered during 2022,\\nand shareholder feedback. Balancing this feedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, a desire to continue to create\\nmeaningful performance and retention incentives, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of\\nthe feedback received, the People and Compensation Committee reduced his 2023 target equity award value while increasing the\\nportion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook from 50% to 75%. Given Apple’s significantly larger size and\\nscope, as compared to its primary peer companies, as well as Mr. Cook’s history of delivering exceptional results, the\\nPeople and Compensation Committee also intends to position his future total target compensation, commensurate with these\\nfactors, between the 80th and 90th percentiles of CEO total target compensation in our primary peer group.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.htm', 'title': '', 'language': 'No language found.'}),\n",

The People and Compensation Committee recognized the significant progress achieved in furtherance\\nof our values and key community initiatives and applied a modifier of 7.5% out of the maximum of 10% resulting in a final Cash Incentive\\nPlan award for 2023 of 178.6% of the target payout opportunity for each of our named executive officers in 2023.\\n\\xa0\\n2023 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results\\n\\xa0\\nWhen setting the value of equity awards for our named\\nexecutive officers, the People and Compensation Committee considers the size and performance of Apple relative to peer companies, and\\nthe scope of our named executive officers’ roles. Each named executive officer other than Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity\\naward on September 25, 2022 of 50% performance-based and 50% time-based RSUs. Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity award on September\\n25, 2022 of 75% performance-based and 25% time-based RSUs.\\n\\xa0\\n2023 Time-Based RSUs\\n\\xa0\\nEquity awards with time-based vesting align the interests\\nof our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive\\nteam over the longer term. Vesting schedules for time-based RSUs are generally longer than our peer companies.\\n\\xa0\\nTime-based RSUs granted to our named\\nexecutive officers on September 25, 2022, will vest in three equal annual installments over approximately four and one-half\\nyears, with the first installment vesting on April 1, 2025 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date),\\nsubject to the award agreements. The number of time-based RSUs granted to each named executive officer was determined by\\ndividing the target value of $10 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for these\\nRSUs is reported in the “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021.”\\n\\xa0\\n2023 Performance-Based RSUs\\n\\xa0\\nThe People and Compensation Committee continued to use\\nRelative TSR as the metric for performance-based RSUs with the S&P 500 as the comparative group because it continues to be an objective\\nand meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and aligns the interests of our named\\nexecutive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value.\\n\\xa0\\nPerformance-based RSUs are a\\nsubstantial, at-risk component of our named executive officers’ compensation tied to Apple’s long-term\\nperformance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest, if any, depends entirely on Relative TSR for the applicable\\nperformance period. To earn the target number of performance-based RSUs, Apple must achieve above-median performance at the\\n55th percentile of the S&P 500. We measure Relative TSR for the applicable performance period based on the change in each\\ncompany’s stock price during the applicable performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that\\nperiod, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. We use a 20-trading-day averaging period to determine the beginning\\nand ending stock price to calculate the TSR of Apple and each company in the S&P 500. This averaging period mitigates the\\nimpact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the\\nperformance period. For each company, the change in stock price from the beginning to the end of the performance period is\\ndivided by the beginning stock price to determine TSR.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.htm', 'title': '', 'language': 'No language found.'}),\n",

The threshold, target, and maximum payout amounts\\n    for each named executive officer’s Cash Incentive Plan payout opportunity for 2023 are shown in the table entitled “Grants\\n    of Plan-Based Awards—2023.” In 2023, Apple’s performance exceeded the target performance goals for both net sales\\n    and operating income, resulting in a preliminary payout of 166.1% of the total target payout opportunity for each named executive\\n    officer. Upon review and discussion with management of the significant actions taken and progress achieved across each of our values\\n    and key community initiatives during 2023, the People and Compensation Committee modified the preliminary payout opportunities by\\n    7.5% and awarded Cash Incentive Plan payouts equal to 178.6% of the target payout opportunity for each of our named executive officers.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\xa0Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n63', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.htm', 'title': '', 'language': 'No language found.'}),\n",

The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the independent registered public\\naccounting firm annually. In making the determination to re-appoint Ernst & Young for 2024, the Audit Committee\\nconsidered, among other factors, the independence and performance of Ernst & Young, and the quality and candor of Ernst\\n&\\xa0Young’s communications with the Audit Committee and management.

(“Apple”) issue\\na public report detailing the potential risks associated with omitting “viewpoint” and “ideology” from\\nits written equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy. The report should be available within a reasonable timeframe, prepared at\\na reasonable expense and omit proprietary information.\\n\\xa0\\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT\\n\\xa0\\nApple does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on viewpoint\\nor ideology in its written EEO policy.\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s lack of a company-wide best practice EEO policy\\nsends mixed signals to company employees and prospective employees and calls into question the extent to which individuals are\\nprotected due to inconsistent state policies and the absence of federal protection for partisan activities. Approximately half\\nof Americans live and work in a jurisdiction with no legal protections if their employer takes action against them for their political\\nactivities. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCompanies with inclusive policies are better able to recruit\\nthe most talented employees from a broad labor pool, resolve complaints internally to avoid costly litigation or reputational damage,\\nand minimize employee turnover.

Inclusion and diversity is one of Apple’s values, which means we want every employee to feel a\\nsense of belonging in the workplace, where their perspectives are respected, sought out, and considered fairly. We believe\\nthat when we create a workplace where everyone feels comfortable sharing their diverse experiences and perspectives, we\\nremove the barriers that prevent people from being fully engaged and, in turn, facilitate creativity and productivity.\\n\\xa0\\nA culture of open dialogue and supportive feedback\\nalso requires respect, including for those with different points of view. That is why respect is a foundational element of our\\nculture. It is necessary for great collaboration. It is necessary for great debate. It is necessary for our ideas, products, and\\nservices to be as great as they can be. We believe every employee has a role in making our workplace respectful and welcoming for\\neveryone, which is why we require every Apple employee to participate in trainings on respect and inclusion.\\n\\xa0\\nOur policies already address the\\nproposal’s concern and therefore a report would not provide additional material information. Because our commitment\\nto a respectful and inclusive workplace is broadly scoped and embedded across our policies, practices, and trainings, we\\nbelieve the risk to Apple of omitting viewpoint or ideology specifically from our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy (EEO\\nPolicy) is low, and a report on potential risks would not provide material additional information to shareholders.\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s EEO Policy states that, “Apple is an equal\\nopportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting” on many specifically enumerated\\ncategories, including any “basis protected by law.” This latter protection would include any state or local law that\\nprovides employees protection with respect to political activities or political affiliation, such as laws in locations like California,\\nNew York State, and Washington D.C. While the proponent’s concerns are already addressed under applicable law, which flows\\nthrough to our EEO Policy, our commitment to inclusion and respect is broader and permeates all our policies and practices.\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Business Conduct and\\nCompliance policies are foundational to how we do business and how we put our values into practice every day. In setting this\\nfoundation, our Business Conduct Policy states, “Apple is dedicated to maintaining a creative, diverse, inclusive, and\\nsupportive work environment, and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of employees or non-employees with whom we\\nhave a business, service, or professional relationship,” thus anchoring our goal of fostering acceptance and supporting\\ndiversity in all of its aspects, including diversity based on differing viewpoints and ideologies, in one of our main guiding\\npolicies. All employees are required to complete training on the Business Conduct Policy upon hiring and annually thereafter.\\nAnd the training makes clear that maintaining a culture where our differences are celebrated is a responsibility shared by\\neveryone at Apple.\\n\\xa0\\nWe want to make sure we’re doing everything we can to safeguard\\nand reinforce a culture free from harassment and discrimination and to ensure employees feel fully empowered to report inappropriate\\nor discriminatory conduct, without fear of retaliation. That is why we also offer a range of resources for employees to address\\nquestions and report concerns, including People Support, the Business Conduct Helpline, and the Business Conduct website, as well', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.htm', 'title': '', 'language': 'No language found.'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='As shareholders of Apple Inc., we believe Apple is uniquely situated\\nto help protect these rights and ought to commit to maintaining access to app services as a necessary consequence of its commitment\\nto human rights.

This censorship endangers Apple’s trust with its users and jeopardizes Apple’s stated\\ncommitments to human rights and providing quality products.

These metrics are assessed by a third-party firm that evaluates compensation across\\nall of Apple using statistical modeling.

This statistic seeks to compare the median of two employees whose\\ncompensation happens to fall at the midpoint of a pay distribution and does not account for valid factors that affect pay, such as role,\\nskills, qualifications, location, country, performance, and experience. Our shareholders would not benefit from a substitute measure for\\nour progress toward a more inclusive workforce, particularly one that does not lend itself to company-to-company comparison due to the\\nhighly divergent composition of workforces based on industry and location.\\n\\xa0\\nApple fosters an inclusive culture to promote\\ndiverse representation. At Apple, we believe building an inclusive culture rooted in community helps everyone, in every part of Apple,\\nfeel supported, valued, connected, and empowered to do the best work of their lives.

For example, our\\nglobal Career Experiences program enables hands-on development opportunities for Apple Store, service, and support team members by creating\\nmonths-long rotations in technical, operations, and corporate functions across Apple. Participants can build new skills, explore an aspirational\\nrole up close, and gain in-role experience, while host teams benefit from the unique customer-facing perspectives, talents, and passions\\nof participants.\\n\\xa0\\nFurther, all our employees are required to complete\\ninclusion training, which reiterates our policies against harassment and discrimination.

We believe that adopting an ethical framework for the use of AI technology will strengthen our company’s\\nposition as a responsible and sustainable leader in its industry. By addressing the ethical considerations of AI in a transparent manner,\\nwe can build trust among our company’s stakeholders and contribute positively to society.\\n\\xa0\\nThe adoption of AI technology into\\nbusiness raises a number of significant social policy issues. For example, the use of AI in human resources decisions may\\nraise concerns about discrimination or bias against employees. The use of AI to automate jobs may result in mass layoffs and\\nthe closing of entire facilities. AI may be used in ways that violate the privacy of customers and members of the public. AI\\ntechnology may be used to generate “deep fake” media content that may result in the dissemination of false\\ninformation in political elections.\\n\\xa0\\nThe White House Office of Science\\nand Technology Policy has developed a set of ethical guidelines to help guide the design, use, and deployment of AI. These\\nfive principles for an AI Bill of Rights are 1) safe and effective systems, 2) algorithmic discrimination protections, 3)\\ndata privacy, 4) notice and explanation, and 5) human alternatives, consideration, and fallback. (White House Office of\\nScience and Technology Policy, “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American\\nPeople,” October 2022, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights).\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe that the adoption of ethical\\nguidelines for the use of AI can help improve our company’s bottom line by avoiding costly labor disruptions. In 2023,\\nwriters and performers went on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers in part over concerns\\nthat the use of AI technology to create media content will infringe on the intellectual property and publicity rights of\\nwriters and performers and potentially displace human creators. (Wall Street Journal, “Hollywood’s Fight: How\\nMuch AI Is Too Much?,” July 31, 2023, available at https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-the-core-of-hollywoods-ai-fight-how-far-is-too-far-f57630df).\\n\\xa0\\nIn our view, AI systems should not be trained on\\ncopyrighted works, or the voices, likenesses and performances of professional performers, without transparency, consent and compensation\\nto creators and rights holders. We also believe that AI should not be used to create literary material, to replace or supplant the creative\\nwork of professional writers.\\n\\xa0\\nFor these reasons, we urge you to vote FOR this\\nshareholder proposal.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBack to Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDirectors\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProposals\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0Information\\n\\xa0\\n2024 Proxy\\xa0Statement\\n\\xa0\\n94\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nApple’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.\\xa07\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAGAINST\\nProposal No. 7', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.htm', 'title': '', 'language': 'No language found.'}),\n",
